"I get it, Russia's international reputation isn't the best these days, but people outright assuming this is an obviously fabricated result despite no specific evidence (and despite The Lancet being a well respected journal) really need to take a step back and think about the way they approach epistemology, and in particular how they decide what media to trust. Blanket distrust of entire broad groups of people sharing but one attribute (in this case, nationality) is typically a pretty big red flag of intellectual dishonesty, and I'm fairly confident will almost invariably be accompanied by *over*trust of other broad groups of people sharing one attribute (i.e. ""this is coming from people in *my team*, it's probably safe to trust it"")

Russia may be crooked and underhanded politically, but they still have legitimately very good scientists. I don't think anyone remotely familiar with the history of science (including its modern history) can really argue against that. Sure, they might not be a *top, top* country right now, but it's not like we're talking about a tiny developing country with virtually no history of scientific research suddenly claiming some unbelievably amazing results. The numbers claimed aren't that special, and the technology used isn't particularly novel (it's not an mRNA vaccine)

So by all means, exercise a healthy degree of skepticism and triple-check everything for any potential issues with methodology, suspicious patterns in reported statistics, etc. That's all fair and good, results should be able to stand on their own (regardless of who the author is) -- but don't reject peer-reviewed research on a serious journal out of hand based on your gut feeling about its country of origin.

>Low serum 25-OHD levels are also extremely common following solid organ transplantation, both during the immediate postoperative period and in long-term graft recipients.

This also is probably the most likely explanation for differences in COVID19 mortality, along with urban air pollution which may correlate loosely with race.

Another factor to think about here. Higher rates of heart disease and poorer outcomes from surgery may be a consequence of pre-existing conditions that *were* in many cases a result of racism - such as poorer diet, which we know can be an outcome of poverty, which in turn can be an outcome of systemic racism literally from decades previously. Heart disease rates track to habbits that people held decades previously so there is a huge delay in such disparities. In this way what is witnessed now may be a cumulative effect of things that happened in the 1960;s, 70's and 80's, especially with respect to illnesses associated with old age.

This is the relevant question.  Without advancing the position beyond stating that these categorizations of preferred teaching/learning styles are not related to results, this doesn't inform teaching practices in the least.  It's not realistic to assumes that a teacher with say, 25 students per class, is going to try to take into account the individual learning styles of each student.  This disavowal of the learning-style perspective may inform practices for tutors, but it seems largely irrelevant on the individual level in full-sized classrooms, where most formal language instruction takes place.

"WASHINGTON--The start of California's annual rainy season has been pushed back from November to December, prolonging the state's increasingly destructive wildfire season by nearly a month, according to new research. The study cannot confirm the shift is connected to climate change, but the results are consistent with climate models that predict drier autumns for California in a warming climate, according to the authors.

Wildfires can occur at any time in California, but fires typically burn from May through October, when the state is in its dry season. The start of the rainy season, historically in November, ends wildfire season as plants become too moist to burn.

California's rainy season has been starting progressively later in recent decades and climate scientists have projected it will get shorter as the climate warms. In the new study, researchers analyzed rainfall and weather data in California over the past six decades. The results show the official onset of California's rainy season is 27 days later than it was in the 1960s and the rain that does fall is being concentrated during the months of January and February.

""What we've shown is that it will not happen in the future, it's happening already,"" said Jelena Lukovi?, a climate scientist at the University of Belgrade in Serbia and lead author of the new study. ""The onset of the rainy season has been progressively delayed since the 1960s, and as a result the precipitation season has become shorter and sharper in California.""

Medicaid and Mortality: New Evidence from Linked Survey and Administrative Data

Abstract

We use large-scale federal survey data linked to administrative death records to investigate the relationship between Medicaid enrollment and mortality. Our analysis compares changes in mortality for near-elderly adults in states with and without Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions. We identify adults most likely to benefit using survey information on socioeconomic status, citizenship status, and public program participation. We find that, prior to the ACA expansions, mortality rates across expansion and nonexpansion states trended similarly, but beginning in the first year of the policy, there were significant reductions in mortality in states that opted to expand relative to nonexpanders. Individuals in expansion states experienced a 0.132 percentage point decline in annual mortality, a 9.4 percent reduction over the sample mean, as a result of the Medicaid expansions. The effect is driven by a reduction in disease-related deaths and grows over time. A variety of alternative specifications, methods of inference, placebo tests, and sample definitions confirm our main result.",science

The research, published today (Feb. 5, 2021) in the journal Science Advances, found “staggering” income losses after the pandemic emerged last year, with a median 70% of households across nine countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America reporting financial losses. By April last year, roughly 50% or more of those surveyed in several countries were forced to eat smaller meals or skip meals altogether, a number that reached 87% for rural households in the West African country of Sierra Leone.

"The economic value of insect pollinators was $34 billion in the U.S. in 2012, much higher than previously thought, according to researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and Penn State University. The team also found that areas that are economically most reliant on insect pollinators are the same areas where pollinator habitat and forage quality are poor.

“Pollinators like bees play an extremely important role in agriculture,” explained senior author Vikas Khanna, Wellington C. Carl Faculty Fellow and associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Pitt’s Swanson School of Engineering. “The insects that pollinate farmers’ crops underpin our ecosystem biodiversity and function, human nutrition, and even economic welfare.” 

But some of those busy little bees are headed for crisis—one-third of managed honey bee colonies die each winter in the U.S., and populations of many wild pollinator species are showing declines as well.

Using publicly available price and production data and existing pollination field studies, the team determined economic dependence of U.S. crops on insect pollination services at the county level, as well as areas where the habitat for wild pollinators has been reduced. One key finding is that the economic value that is dependent on insect pollination totaled $34 billion in 2012, much higher than previously thought. The team looked at 2012 because it was the most recent year for which data were available.

"A groundbreaking new study has shown that traumatic or stressful events in childhood may lead to tiny changes in key brain structures that can now be identified decades later.

The study is the first to show that trauma or maltreatment during a child’s early years—a well-known risk factor for developing mental health conditions such as major depressive disorder in adulthood—triggers changes in specific sub-regions of the amygdala and the hippocampus.

Once these changes occur, researchers believe the affected regions of the brain may not function as well, potentially increasing the risk of developing mental health disorders as adults during times of stress.

""Now that we can actually identify which specific sub-regions of the amygdala or the hippocampus are permanently altered by incidents of childhood abuse, trauma or mistreatment, we can start to focus on how to mitigate or even potentially reverse these changes,” said Peter Silverstone, interim chair of the Department of Psychiatry and one of a team of eight U of A researchers who conducted the study.

"Our minds may be affected by winter’s long nights or spring flowers, but what about our bodies? A new study at the Weizmann Institute of Science reveals that our hormones also follow a seasonal pattern. By analyzing the data on several kinds of hormone from millions of blood tests, the researchers discovered that some hormones peak in winter or spring, and others in summer. This research provides a broad, dynamic picture of hormone production – covering those connected, for example, to fertility, but also hormones such as cortisol, which are mostly short-lived and not  thought to be seasonal.

Alon Bar led the study together with Avichai Tendler; both are research students in Prof. Uri Alon’s group at the Institute’s Molecular Cell Biology Department. Alon and his group have developed mathematical tools for uncovering patterns in big biological data, so when a study they had undertaken that focused on a single hormone – cortisol – started to reveal a surprising seasonal pattern, the research team decided to see whether other hormones might also fluctuate seasonally. They turned to Prof. Amos Tanay of the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Department, who has access to a database maintained by the Clalit health maintenance organization. Clalit is the largest HMO in Israel and a leader in creating a database that enables researchers to conduct large-scale biomedical studies while fully preserving the subjects’ anonymity.

[Once-Weekly Semaglutide in Adults with Overweight or Obesity](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183)

> Abstract


>BACKGROUND
Obesity is a global health challenge with few pharmacologic options. Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed.


>METHODS
In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (?27 in persons with ?1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions.


>RESULTS
The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was ?14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with ?2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of ?12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], ?13.4 to ?11.5; P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was ?15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with ?2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, ?12.7 kg; 95% CI, ?13.7 to ?11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]).

>CONCLUSIONS
In participants with overweight or obesity, 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly plus lifestyle intervention was associated with sustained, clinically relevant reduction in body weight. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; STEP 1 Clinical",science

In addition, adulteration with soybean oil at levels near 100% was confirmed in two “extra virgin” and one “refined” sample.

## Abstract

Zoonotic pandemics, like that caused by SARS-CoV-2, can follow the spillover of animal viruses into highly susceptible human populations. Their descendants have adapted to the human host and evolved to evade immune pressure. Coronaviruses acquire substitutions more slowly than other RNA viruses, due to a proofreading polymerase. In the spike glycoprotein, we find recurrent deletions overcome this slow substitution rate. Deletion variants arise in diverse genetic and geographic backgrounds, transmit efficiently, and are present in novel lineages, including those of current global concern. They frequently occupy recurrent deletion regions (RDRs), which map to defined antibody epitopes. Deletions in RDRs confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. By altering stretches of amino acids, deletions appear to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution and may, more generally, drive adaptive evolution.",science

Methods: We described all adults with COVID-19 or influenza discharged from inpatient medical services and medical–surgical intensive care units (ICUs) between Nov. 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, at 7 hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario. We compared patient outcomes using multivariable regression models, controlling for patient sociodemographic factors and comorbidity level. We validated the accuracy of 7 externally developed risk scores to predict mortality among patients with COVID-19.

Results: There were 1027 hospital admissions with COVID-19 (median age 65 yr, 59.1% male) and 783 with influenza (median age 68 yr, 50.8% male). Patients younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all admissions for COVID-19 and 24.0% of ICU admissions. Compared with influenza, patients with COVID-19 had significantly greater in-hospital mortality (unadjusted 19.9% v. 6.1%, adjusted relative risk [RR] 3.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.56–4.68), ICU use (unadjusted 26.4% v. 18.0%, adjusted RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.25–1.80) and hospital length of stay (unadjusted median 8.7 d v. 4.8 d, adjusted rate ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.25–1.69). Thirty-day readmission was not significantly different (unadjusted 9.3% v. 9.6%, adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.70–1.39). Three points-based risk scores for predicting in-hospital mortality showed good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] ranging from 0.72 to 0.81) and calibration.

Interpretation: During the first wave of the pandemic, admission to hospital for COVID-19 was associated with significantly greater mortality, ICU use and hospital length of stay than influenza. Simple risk scores can predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 with good accuracy.",science

With questionable vaccine efficacy in the face of increasingly prevalent viral escape mutations, and an ever worsening global pandemic, early antiviral therapies make the most sense to me.

"Scientists at HSE University have learned that disagreeing with the opinion of other people leaves a ‘trace’ in brain activity, which allows the brain to later adjust its opinion in favour of the majority-held point of view. The article was published in Scientific Reports.

We often change our beliefs under the influence of others. This social behavior is called conformity and explains varios components of our behaviour, from voting at elections to fashion trends among teenagers.

Brain research has recently well  informed about short-term effects of social influence on decision making. If our choice coincides with the point of view of the people who are important to us, this decision is reinforced in the brain's “pleasure” centres involved in the larger  dopaminergic  system responsible for  learning, motor activity and many other functions. Conversely, in instances of disagreement with others, the brain signals that a ‘mistake’ has been made and triggers conformity.

However, there is little study of how social influence affects brain activity once some time has passed after we have formed an opinion and learned of the opinion held by others. HSE neuroscientists decided to study whether the opinion of others causes long-term changes in brain activity. The scientists used magnetoencephalography (MEG), a unique method that allows you to see in detail activity of the human brain during information processing, and it has a temporal resolution higher than that of traditional fMRI.

> Recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated significant reduction of cancer mortality by vitamin D supplementation. We estimated costs and savings for preventing cancer deaths by vitamin D supplementation of the population aged 50+ years in Germany. Our analysis is based on national data on cancer mortality in 2016. The number of preventable cancer deaths was estimated by multiplying cancer deaths above age 50 with the estimated proportionate reduction of cancer mortality derived by vitamin D supplementation according to meta-analyses of RCTs (13%). Saved costs were estimated by multiplying this number by estimated end-of-life cancer care costs (€40,000). Annual costs of vitamin D supplementation were estimated at 25€ per person above age 50. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. In the main analysis, vitamin D supplementation was estimated to prevent almost 30,000 cancer deaths per year at approximate costs of €900 million and savings of €1.154 billion, suggesting net savings of €254 million. Our results support promotion of supplementation of vitamin D among older adults as a cost saving approach to substantially reduce cancer mortality.

In a paper published February 2, 2021 in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health , scientists at University of California San Diego, with colleagues elsewhere, describe chronic mental health problems among some residents who experienced the Camp Fire in varying degrees.

Direct exposure to large-scale fires significantly increased the risk for mental health disorders, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, the scientists wrote.

“We looked for symptoms of these particular disorders because emotionally traumatic events in one’s lifetime are known to trigger them,” said senior author Jyoti Mishra, PhD, professor in the Department of Psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and co-director of the Neural Engineering and Translation Labs at UC San Diego.

"Researchers from the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (ICTA-UAB) warn of the impact the current tourism model in the Mediterranean islands has on the production of marine litter on beaches, and recommend taking advantage of the situation generated by the Covid19 pandemic to rethink a new more sustainable model. The research, recently published in the journal Scientific Reports, shows that the recreational use of Mediterranean island beaches during the summer is responsible for up to 80% of the marine litter accumulating on those beaches, and generates huge amounts of microplastics through the fragmentation of larger plastic items.

The international study led by ICTA-UAB researchers has analysed the effects of waste generated by tourism on eight Mediterranean islands over the past four years. The marine litter, including microplastics, can be defined as any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment.

## What Did We Learn from the Kaggle Competition?

Previous work on seismic data from Earth ([**3**](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/5/e2011362118#ref-3)) suggests that the underlying physics may scale from a laboratory fault to large fault systems in Earth. If this is indeed the case, improvements in our ability to predict earthquakes in the laboratory could lead to significant progress in time-dependent earthquake hazard characterization. The ultimate goal of the earthquake prediction challenge was to identify promising ML approaches for seismic data analysis that may enable improved estimates of fault failure in the Earth. In the following, we will discuss shortcomings of the competition but also key innovations that improved laboratory quake predictions and may be transposed to Earth studies.

The approaches employed by the winning teams included several innovations considerably different from our initial work on laboratory quake prediction ([**1**](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/5/e2011362118#ref-1)). Team Zoo added synthetic noise to the input seismic data before feature computing and model training, thus making their models more robust to noise and more likely to generalize.

Team Zoo, JunKoda, and GloryorDeath only considered features that exhibited similar distributions between the training and testing data, thereby ensuring that nonstationary features could not be used in the learning phase and again, improving model generalization. We note that employing the distribution of the testing set input is a form of data snooping that effectively made the test set actually a validation set. However, the idea of employing only features with distributions that do not evolve over time is insightful and could be used for scientific purposes by comparing feature distribution between portions of training data, for example.

Perhaps most interestingly from a physical standpoint, the fifth team, Team Reza, changed the target to be predicted and endeavored to predict the seismic cycle fraction remaining instead of time remaining before failure. Because they did not employ the approach of comparing input distribution between training and testing sets as done by the first, second, and fourth teams, the performance impact from the prediction of normalized time to failure (seismic cycle fraction) was significant.

As in any level of statistics, more data are in general better and can improve model performance. Thus, had the competitors been given more training data, in principle scores may have improved. At the same time, there is an element of nonstationarity in the experiment because the fault gouge layer thins as the experiment progresses, and therefore, even an extremely large dataset would not lead to a perfect prediction. In addition, Kaggle keeps the public/private test set split in such a way as to not reward overfitting. No matter how large the dataset is, if a model iterates enough times on that dataset, it will not translate well into “the",science

### Summary

**What is already known about this topic?**

Correct use of face masks limits COVID-19 transmission. Many institutions of higher education mandate masks in public indoor locations and outdoors when within six feet of others.

**What is added by this report?**

During September–November 2020, mask use was directly observed at six universities with mask mandates. Among persons observed indoors, 91.7% wore masks correctly, varying by mask type, from 96.8% for N95-type masks and 92.2% for cloth masks to 78.9% for bandanas, scarves, and similar face coverings.

**What are the implications for public health practice?**

"In the span of only 15 years, a small academic elite has increased its share of academic citations significantly. In the year 2000, 14 per cent of all citations went to the top one percent of the most cited researchers. New research shows that this figure had risen to 21 per cent in 2015.

The people behind these remarkable findings are senior researcher Jens Peter Andersen, Danish Center for Studies in Research and Research Policy (CFA) at Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University, and associate professor Mathias Wullum Nielsen (former CFA, now University of Copenhagen). Their examination of almost 26 million scientific papers and four million authors has just been published in the well-established interdisciplinary journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

" Abstract

To date, no review has focused specifically on the potential modulating role of environmental temperature on the effects of exercise on cognitive function. Despite this, a range of occupations and performance contexts exist (e.g., military personnel, emergency services, sport) where the maintenance of cognitive function in environmentally challenging environments is crucial. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to evaluate the experimental research investigating how manipulating environmental temperature influenced the effects of acute bouts exercise on cognitive functioning from pre-to post-exercise, or during exercise. Studies to be included were assessed by two authors reviewing title, abstract, and then full-text. From the searches conducted, twenty articles were identified which met the inclusion criteria. For the purpose of this review, exercise involved in each study was categorised into low, moderate, and vigorous dosages (dependent on intensity and duration). **The results indicate that moderate dosages of exercise help stimulate improved cognitive performance from pre-to-post exercise in temperate conditions, where cold exposure appears to blunt these effects. In addition, hot environments led to cognitive decrements during and post exercise which were often identified in studies that implemented prolonged moderate or vigorous exercise protocols. Therefore, suggesting a combination of heightened physiological strain from increased dose of exercise, alongside heat exposure, can be detrimental to optimal cognitive functioning, whereby executive functioning tasks appeared to be most affected.** The findings from this systematic review highlight the potential modulating role of environmental temperature on the effects of exercise on cognitive function. Thus, highlighting the importance of considering the role of environmental temperature for individuals either exercising to elicit desired cognitive benefits or for those involved in physically demanding occupations or performance domains.",science

"**Title**: CP-Violating Neutrino Nonstandard Interactions in Long-Baseline-Accelerator Data

**Authors**: Peter B. Denton, Julia Gehrlein, and Rebekah Pestes

**Journal**: Physical Review Letters

**arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01110

**Abstract**: Neutrino oscillations in matter provide a unique probe of new physics. Leveraging the advent of neutrino appearance data from NOvA and T2K in recent years, we investigate the presence of CP-violating neutrino nonstandard interactions in the oscillation data. We first show how to very simply approximate the expected NSI parameters to resolve differences between two long-baseline appearance experiments analytically. Then, by combining recent NOvA and T2K data, we find a tantalizing hint of CP-violating NSI preferring a new complex phase that is close to maximal: ?e? or ?e??3?/2 with |?e?| or |?e?|?0.2. We then compare the results from long-baseline data to constraints from IceCube and COHERENT.

**Summary**: Neutrinos, fundamental particles, change their identity during propagation, this is known as oscillation and is the only known particle physics that goes beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This phenomenon was discovered about 20 years ago and since then there has been a growing global effort to measure the relevant parameters (there are at least 7 new parameters, 6 of which can be probed via oscillations) and to generally understand oscillations.

The most sophisticated measurements come in the form of long-baseline accelerator experiments. In these, accelerators collide high energy protons onto a fixed target producing a shower of secondary particles. These are focused and then they decay into neutrinos. These neutrinos propagate through the Earth into detectors hundreds of miles/km away. The detectors then identify which kind of neutrino they see to understand how they oscillate. There are two such experiments in operation now, T2K in Japan and NOvA in the US.

This summer, they announced new data and there is a slight disagreement. The preferred regions of the parameters, assuming a standard oscillation scenario, can be seen [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eb7UvGbUcAIeb7Y?format=jpg&name=medium) where black is T2K and blue is NOvA. The significances are low, but for neutrino experiments where events trickle in one at a time, this is how things work.

The linked paper asks and answers the question, ""If this is new physics beyond the standard three flavor oscillation picture, what is it and is it compatible with other measurements?"" The scenario considered is neutrino non-standard interactions. As the presence of matter affects oscillations (the Earth is made of electrons not muons or taus) a new interaction between neutrinos and the Earth would further modify the propagation. In addition, because the neutrinos at NOvA are higher energies than those at T2K, they would modify the propagation differently for each experiment. Also, because NOvA and T2K are sensitive to CP violatin",science

"This report by the Lancet Commission on Public Policy and Health in the Trump Era assesses the repercussions of President Donald Trump's health-related policies and examines the failures and social schisms that enabled his election. Trump exploited low and middle-income white people's anger over their deteriorating life prospects to mobilise racial animus and xenophobia and enlist their support for policies that benefit high-income people and corporations and threaten health. 

His signature legislative achievement, a trillion-dollar tax cut for corporations and high-income individuals, opened a budget hole that he used to justify cutting food subsidies and health care. His appeals to racism, nativism, and religious bigotry have emboldened white nationalists and vigilantes, and encouraged police violence and, at the end of his term in office, insurrection. 

He chose judges for US courts who are dismissive of affirmative action and reproductive, labour, civil, and voting rights; ordered the mass detention of immigrants in hazardous conditions; and promulgated regulations that reduce access to abortion and contraception in the USA and globally. Although his effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed, he weakened its coverage and increased the number of uninsured people by 2·3 million, even before the mass dislocation of the COVID-19 pandemic, and has accelerated the privatisation of government health programmes. 

Trump's hostility to environmental regulations has already worsened pollution—resulting in more than 22?000 extra deaths in 2019 alone—hastened global warming, and despoiled national monuments and lands sacred to Native people. Disdain for science and cuts to global health programmes and public health agencies have impeded the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, causing tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths, and imperil advances against HIV and other diseases.

Fecal transplant turns cancer immunotherapy non-responders into responders

Davar and colleagues collected fecal samples from patients who responded extraordinarily well to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and tested for infectious pathogens before giving the samples, through colonoscopy, to advanced melanoma patients who had never previously responded to immunotherapy. The patients were then given the anti-PD-1 drug pembrolizumab. And it worked.

Even if much work remains to be done, our study raises hope for microbiome-based therapies of cancers.

Fecal microbiota transplant overcomes resistance to anti–PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients

New fecal microbiota for cancer patients

The composition of the gut microbiome influences the response of cancer patients to immunotherapies. Baruch et al. and Davar et al. report first-in-human clinical trials to test whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can affect how metastatic melanoma patients respond to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Woelk and Snyder). Both studies observed evidence of clinical benefit in a subset of treated patients. This included increased abundance of taxa previously shown to be associated with response to anti–PD-1, increased CD8+ T cell activation, and decreased frequency of interleukin-8–expressing myeloid cells, which are involved in immunosuppression. These studies provide proof-of-concept evidence for the ability of FMT to affect immunotherapy response in cancer patients.

Abstract

Anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy provides long-term clinical benefits to patients with advanced melanoma. The composition of the gut microbiota correlates with anti–PD-1 efficacy in preclinical models and cancer patients. To investigate whether resistance to anti–PD-1 can be overcome by changing the gut microbiota, this clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of responder-derived fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) together with anti–PD-1 in patients with PD-1–refractory melanoma. This combination was well tolerated, provided clinical benefit in 6 of 15 patients, and induced rapid and durable microbiota perturbation. Responders exhibited increased abundance of taxa that were previously shown to be associated with response to anti–PD-1, increased CD8+ T cell activation, and decreased frequency of interleukin-8–expressing myeloid cells. Responders had distinct proteomic and metabolomic signatures, and transkingdom network analyses confirmed that the gut microbiome regulated these changes. Collectively, our findings show that FMT and anti–PD-1 changed the gut microbiome and reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment to overcome resistance to anti–PD-1 in a subset of PD",science

Abstract

>  The discovery of a dismantled stone circle—close to Stonehenge's bluestone quarries in west Wales—raises the possibility that a 900-year-old legend about Stonehenge being built from an earlier stone circle contains a grain of truth. Radiocarbon and OSL dating of Waun Mawn indicate construction *c*. 3000 BC, shortly before the initial construction of Stonehenge. The identical diameters of Waun Mawn and the enclosing ditch of Stonehenge, and their orientations on the midsummer solstice sunrise, suggest that at least part of the Waun Mawn circle was brought from west Wales to Salisbury Plain. This interpretation complements recent isotope work that supports a hypothesis of migration of both people and animals from Wales to Stonehenge.",science

"""Over the past few decades lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technology has been heralded as the answer to a range of biological, chemical and global-healthcare challenges [1–4]. While most of the work done to date has been in research laboratories, some of the most exciting and impactful applications for LOC technologies are in the development of rapid point-of-care (POC) diagnostics for infectious diseases in developing countries, where resources for healthcare are most scarce [5]. Potential applications include the isolation and detection of non-communicable diseases in informal settlements and remote rural areas in lower middle-income countries (LMICs). However, in-spite of the decades of research invested already, LOC technology is yet to see meaningful adoption, research, and deployment in the LMICs where it is often of most value. The reason for this is most likely a question of cost, both at the research level as well as the mass manufacturing stage.

LOC technologies are underpinned by the field of microfluidics, referring to the control and manipulation of fluid volumes of the order ?L or nL. This takes place within micro-scale channels where macroscale behaviour breaks down and unique microscale phenomena dominate [6]. The precise manipulation and analysis of chemical and cellular behaviour, often performed under microscope, is then achievable.""",science

Background

In the midst of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, a lot more chaos could be anticipated in the flu season due to the coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza with almost similar epidemiologic and clinical features. Could this become a ""twindemic"" or “syndemic” if there is any viral interference occurs? We investigated the effect of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines on the disease course of SARS-CoV-2 in the pediatric population and the possibility of viral interference.

Material and methods

After approval from Institutional Review Board, a retrospective electronic chart review on 20 years and younger SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive patients who visited Arkansas Children’s Hospital System between February 1 to August 30, 2020, was performed. The clinical data was collected along with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status of these patients.

Results

The results showed that viral interference may have played a role in the current flu and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) twindemic. SARS-CoV-2 and influenza may have significantly affected each other’s epidemiological features.

Conclusion

Understanding the relationship and co-existence of other viruses alongside SARS-CoV-2 and knowing the vaccination status of the host population may help in deploying the right strategies to get the best outcomes.

"Abstract

Zoonotic pandemics, like that caused by SARS-CoV-2, can follow the spillover of animal viruses into highly susceptible human populations. Their descendants have adapted to the human host and evolved to evade immune pressure. Coronaviruses acquire substitutions more slowly than other RNA viruses, due to a proofreading polymerase. In the spike glycoprotein, we find recurrent deletions overcome this slow substitution rate. Deletion variants arise in diverse genetic and geographic backgrounds, transmit efficiently, and are present in novel lineages, including those of current global concern. They frequently occupy recurrent deletion regions (RDRs), which map to defined antibody epitopes. Deletions in RDRs confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. By altering stretches of amino acids, deletions appear to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution and may, more generally, drive adaptive evolution.",science

"The post title is a paraphrase of key findings in the abstract. The study examines behavior of 600 subjects across multiple classic games from experimental economics. Exogenous variations in local PM2.5 pollution cause the listed results. Sessions were run “in Beijing [China] in October 2012 over five days with highly varying levels of PM2.5, which only became commonly known in China in 2013.” This adds to the growing literature of the effects of pollution on the human body and human behavior.

**Title:** Does haze cloud decision making? A natural laboratory experiment

**Authors:** Soo Hong Chew, Wei Huang, & Xun Li

**Journal:** Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization (Feb 2021; Vol 182, pp 132-161)

**Abstract:** The adverse impact of haze on health and its association with a range of economic outcomes have received increasing attention in the literature. A natural laboratory experiment involving more than 600 subjects enables a first attempt at investigating the causal effect of haze, proxied by particulate matter of up to 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5) on decision making. This study was conducted in Beijing in October 2012 over five days with highly varying levels of PM2.5, which only became commonly known in China in 2013. We observed several effects associated with an increase in haze. In terms of individual decision making, we found increases in risk aversion and ambiguity aversion over gains. In terms of other-regarding behavior, subjects became less prosocial, giving less in a dictator game, contributing less in a public goods game, and reciprocating less in a sequential prisoners’ dilemma. Our results underpin several reported findings in the literature linking short-term variations in air quality to real-world economic variables, including stock market performance, worker productivity, movie attendance and revenue, criminal activities, and subjective wellbeing.

"The Spanish flu was the greatest demographic catastrophe in Switzerland’s recent history, causing approximately 25,000 deaths in the country during 1918 and 1919. In the wake of the current coronavirus pandemic, there has been increased public and scientific interest in the events of that time. An interdisciplinary team of researchers in evolutionary medicine, history, geography and epidemiology from the universities of Zurich and Toronto has spent several years analyzing historical data on the spread of influenza-like illnesses during 1918 and 1919 in the Canton of Bern. The canton is ideally suited as a Swiss case study, because it is large and has a diverse landscape, it was hit particularly hard by the Spanish flu, and right at the start of the pandemic in July 1918 it introduced an obligation to report cases.

Public health measures effective in the first wave
The results of the new study show that the spread of Spanish flu differed depending on the region. In the first wave in July and August 1918, the Canton of Bern intervened relatively quickly, strongly and centrally, including by restricting gatherings and closing schools. “We see from the numbers that these measures – similar to today – were associated with a decrease in infection numbers,” says co-first author Kaspar Staub of the Institute of Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich. After the first wave had subsided, the canton lifted all measures entirely in September 1918, which led to a rapid resurgence of cases and the onset of a second wave after only a short time.

Delayed action at start of second wave was fatal
At the beginning of the second wave in October 1918, the Canton of Bern reacted hesitantly, unlike in the first wave. Fearing renewed economic consequences, the cantonal authorities left responsibility for new measures up to the individual municipalities for several weeks. “This hesitant and decentralized approach was fatal and contributed to the fact that the second wave became all the stronger and lasted longer,” says co-first author Peter Jüni of the University of Toronto. 

In addition, shortly after the peak of the second wave in November 2018, there was a national strike with demonstrations on social and labor issues and, most importantly, larger troop deployments. These mass gatherings, as well as a subsequent relaxation of the ban on gatherings when the number of cases was still far too high, were accompanied by a significant resurgence in infections. Ultimately, about 80 percent of the reported illnesses and deaths were attributable to the second wave.

"This was very interesting.  Go to figure 5 in the actual paper to see some of the basis of these statements below.
>Looking at data of comparable working conditions over 100 shifts, the researchers found Black officers make 15.16 fewer stops and 1.93 fewer arrests than white officers on average. They also use force 0.10 fewer times than white counterparts, on average.

0.1 fewer TIMES over 100 shifts for use of force.  That's not 10%, that's a numerical 0.1 fewer times over 100 shifts, that's 0.001%.  But when broken down by predominant ethnicity of the neighborhood, it becomes even more interesting.  Very curiously, the data does not provide any analysis on how the race of the officer's numbers differ based on neighborhood ethnicity.  For example, do white officers make the same approximate number of stops regardless of neighborhood?  I see white vs. black officers contrasted here, but not white officer in black neighborhood vs white in white neighborhood.  We should be looking at consistency as well, which will give us a better feel for racial bias.  We'd also need to correct for violent and petty crime rates.  I would not be surprised to see violent crime enforcement to show little difference across the board, but you'd probably see more volatility for petty crime.

Some interesting analysis, but needs a lot more research.  Would love to see this carried a bit further.

"A tiny population of neurons known to be important to appetite appear to also have a significant role in depression that results from unpredictable, chronic stress, scientists say.

These AgRP neurons reside exclusively in the bottom portion of the hypothalamus called the arcuate nucleus, or ARC, and are known to be important to energy homeostasis in the body as well prompting us to pick up a fork when we are hungry and see food.

Now Medical College of Georgia scientists and their colleagues report the first evidence that, not short-term stress, like a series of tough college exams, rather chronic, unpredictable stress like that which erupts in our personal and professional lives, induces changes in the function of AgRP neurons that may contribute to depression, they write.

The small number of AgRP neurons likely are logical treatment targets for depression, says Dr. Xin-Yun Lu, chair of the Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at MCG at Augusta University and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Translational Neuroscience.

While it's too early to say if the shift in neuron activity prompted by chronic stress and associated with depression starts with these neurons, they are a definite and likely key piece of the puzzle, says Lu, corresponding author of the study in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.

""It is clear that when we manipulate these neurons, it changes behavioral reactions,"" she says, but many questions remain, like how these AgRP neurons in the human brain help us cope with and adapt to unpredictable chronic stress over time.

">Abstract
In his book Coercion and Its Fallout Murray Sidman argued against the use of punishment based on concerns about its shortcomings and side effects. Among his concerns were the temporary nature of response suppression produced by punishment, the dangers of conditioned punishment, increases in escape and avoidance responses, punishment?induced aggression, and the development of countercontrol. This paper revisits Sidman's arguments about these putative shortcomings and side effects by examining the available data. Although Sidman's concerns are reasonable and should be considered when using any form of behavioral control, there appears to be a lack of strong empirical support for the notion that these potential problems with punishment are necessarily ubiquitous, long?lasting, or specific to punishment. We describe the need for additional research on punishment in general, and especially on its putative shortcomings and side effects. We also suggest the need for more effective formal theories of punishment that provide a principled account of how, why, and when lasting effects of punishment and its potential side effects might be expected to occur or not. In addition to being necessary for a complete account of behavior, such data and theories might contribute to improved interventions for problems of human concern.",science
"Joe Biden is the new president of the United States, although half of the country’s Republicans believe he stole the election. A lot of people believe conspiracy theories on the other side of the Atlantic. But they aren’t only found there.

Conspiracy theories are not exclusive to people who storm the U.S. Capitol.

“Everyone believes at least one conspiracy theory,” says Asbjørn Dyrendal, a professor in NTNU’s Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies who specializes in conspiracy theories.

The more conspiracy theories you bring up, the more people answer yes to one of them.

That fact leads American conspiracy researcher Joseph Uscinski at the University of Miami to posit that all people believe in at least one conspiracy theory. Dyrendal basically agrees, but he modifies Uscinski’s statement slightly, saying all people believe some conspiracy theory “a little.”

Referee has it out for your team
Maybe you don’t think that the earth is flat or that the moon landings were faked and kept under wraps by all the 400 000 individuals involved. Maybe you don’t believe that vaccines cause autism and that the authorities are doing this on purpose, or that 5G is messing up your head, even if you’re not exactly alone in that case.

We are all more vulnerable to believing what we think is right, especially when our identity is at stake and emotions are strong. It can be a bit like the emotions associated with football.


“Maybe you think the referee is out to get your football team, especially when one of your team’s players gets fouled in the box and no penalty is called,” says Dyrendal.

“These examples activate the same mechanisms that come into play when our thoughts build on themselves and turn into more entrenched conspiracy beliefs.”

Maybe you even think a lot of referees are against your team, especially if you believe you’re seeing a pattern, like your team never or only rarely getting a penalty kick.


This thinking doesn’t usually amount to a conspiracy theory in and of itself. But the same mechanisms come into play when thoughts build on themselves and turn into more entrenched conspiracy beliefs.

People can have degrees of conspiracy thinking as well. There’s a difference between yelling at the ref in a heated moment and believing that the earth is flat.

Common traits
You can find people who believe in the most unusual conspiracy theories everywhere, perhaps even in your own mirror.

“But several common characteristics recur often,” says Dyrendal.

Conspiracy theorists typically:

tend to have a little less education.
more often live in societies that have less successful democracies, which influences trust in others and in the authorities.

belong to groups that feel they should have more power and influence.

belong to special political organizations or religious groups a little more often.

more often use intuition – their “gut feeling” – when making decisions.

" Background

Relative activity deficits found in people with (verses without) depression symptoms/disorders may accumulate uniformly throughout the day, or they may tend to be expressed at specific times. Evidence for the latter would suggest times when behavioral approaches are most needed to reduce depression and its health consequences.

### Methods

We performed a secondary-data analysis of participants who contributed valid accelerometer data at the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n=4390). Participants were categorized according to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 standard cut-point of ?10 (i.e., people with versus without clinically significant depression symptoms). Average levels of accelerometer-measured activity in two-hour bins were the dependent variable in mixed models testing if the relationship between depression status and activity level differed by time of day; and if any such relations varied by age group (18-29 years, 30-44 years, 45-59 years, and 60+ years).

### Results

In adults over the age of 30, people with depression symptoms had generally lower levels of activity across the day, but these effects were most markedly pronounced in the morning hours. We found no differences in activity levels associated with prevalent depression symptoms among people 18-30 years of age.

### Limitations

Core aspects of depression pathophysiology that produce these different activity patterns and confer their effects on mood were not measured.

### Conclusions

In adults 30 years and older, efforts to ameliorate relative activity deficits associated with depression may benefit from considering the apparently outsized role of inactivity that occurs in the morning.",science
"Genes that determine the shape of a person's facial profile have been discovered by a UCL-led research team.

The researchers identified 32 gene regions that influenced facial features such as nose, lip, jaw, and brow shape, nine of which were entirely new discoveries while the others validated genes with prior limited evidence.

The analysis of data from more than 6,000 volunteers across Latin America was published today in Science Advances.

The international research team, led from UCL, Aix-Marseille University and The Open University, found that one of the genes appears to have been inherited from the Denisovans, an extinct group of ancient humans who lived tens of thousands of years ago.

The team found that the gene, TBX15, which contributes to lip shape, was linked with genetic data found in the Denisovan people, providing a clue to the gene's origin. The Denisovans lived in central Asia, and other studies suggest they interbred with modern humans, as some of their DNA lives on in Pacific Islanders and Indigenous people of the Americas.

"I work on the most domestic solar saturated power grid in the world. Domestic solar has been an expensive endeavour for us and I can safely assume every other power grid it’s utilised on would be the same.

Transformer imbalances, feeder imbalances, vector changes, high network neutral currents, issue with voltage regulation due to solar raising the voltage in order to export, high load fluctuations, issues with not properly isolating when there is a network outage (anti islanding protection failure), stupidly high feed in tariffs, constant network monitoring and updates etc all cost a lot of money to deal with. 

It’s increased costs due to pretty much reshaping how the grid is meant to work in an extremely short amount of time.

"I saw a lack of evidence to support the headline. I work in an electric utility. The cost of electricity (rate) is based in several factors:
1) cost of maintenance 
2) upgrades
3) other factors (but I’m focusing on the first two for my point)

Storms cause huge problems. The damage to infrastructure is inherently large. Think of a thunderstorm that rolls through and your town loses power. Poles down ($), conductor down ($$), manpower to fix all this ($$$).

That goes into a rate case to recoup losses from things like that, causing rates to go up. Solar panels give the owner the benefit of net metering (your meter spinning backwards as you generate onto the grid), but your neighbor’s meter is still spinning forwards when that generation moves into their home. 

Generation costs and transmission costs are worked into your bill, but cost is largely based in usage x rate. Your solar panels do not reduce your neighbor’s rate. 

Solar panels themselves pose an interesting problem: you stop paying the utility for power (good for you, bad for them), but you still require a CONNECTION and the on-demand nature of the product. At night, you need the grid to supply your home when you aren’t generating. But all day you don’t pay for that. 

So the utility revenue goes down. This is concerning because recouping costs for infrastructure repairs (from storms) and upgrading the grid are necessary to stay in business. So the revenue is a percentage of what it was and the need for infrastructure investment is still there. One could even argue it is increasing with the increase in storm activity as a result of climate change. Sure, generation costs are worked into the Bill. The utility passes those costs on to you. So in the sense that the utility pays for higher cost generation, and that amount of generation is reduced minutely by solar panels...sure. But utilities are buying gigawatts of electricity and home solar means they buy a megawatt less (whoopdee). So the total generation cost passed on is reduced negligibly. 

I would not be surprised to see distribution network surcharges for those with solar for their grid connection in the future. Not even on a “need to make money” basis, but on an infrastructure necessity to be able to provide on demand power. People with solar are still using the grid: they require the utility infrastructure to deliver their product. Basically, if you’re selling something, and you use my car to do it...I’m going to charge you for use of my car.",science

The aim of this study was to conduct an updated meta?analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of the ablative procedures capsulotomy and cingulotomy and deep brain stimulation.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed search to identify all clinical trials on capsulotomy, cingulotomy, and DBS. Random effects meta?analyses were performed on 38 articles with a primary focus on efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms as measured by a reduction in the **Yale?Brown Obsessive?Compulsive Scale (Y?BOCS)** score and the responder rate (?35% reduction in Y?BOCS score).

Results

**With responder rates of 48% and 53% after 12–16 months and 56% and 57% at last follow?up for ABL and DBS, respectively, and large effect sizes in the reduction in Y?BOCS scores, both surgical modalities show effectiveness in treating refractory OCD.** Meta?regression did not show a statistically significant difference between ABL and DBS regarding these outcomes. Regarding adverse events, a statistically significant higher rate of impulsivity is reported in studies on DBS.

Conclusion

This meta?analysis shows equal efficacy of ABL and DBS in the treatment of refractory OCD. For now, the choice of intervention should, therefore, rely on factors such as risk of developing impulsivity, patient preferences, and experiences of psychiatrist and neurosurgeon. Future research should provide more insight regarding differences between ABL and DBS and response prediction following direct comparisons between the surgical modalities, to enable personalized and legitimate choices between ABL and DBS.",science

"This is no surprise. There have been clinicians specialising in anxiety treatment only who have focused on breathing re-education for decades. 

It has been known for centuries that “breathing into a paper bag” can address anxiety. This actually works, because it increases the amount of CO2 in the blood. Low CO2 levels in the blood are a feature of anxiety—either as a primary cause or a secondary cause. (For example, a little anxiety causes a bit of hyperventilation which causes CO2 levels to drop causing a feedback loop of increasing anxiety.)

CBT may be the dominant “gold star” approach because the data about respiratory approaches are not well known. Hopefully this helps to educate GPs about the effectiveness of RT for anxiety.",science

"My girlfriend and I were in Paris between Christmas and New Years 2019.  We were going to all the sites, standing in long lines with people from all over the world.

Early in January she got very sick.  She was having trouble breathing when sleeping on her back among other symptoms.  

About a week later, I got ill.  I had a very high fever, soaking my sheets at night and a dry cough that could go on for minutes.  If it was the flu, it was definitely the worst one I’ve ever had.  In June and July I was playing a lot of golf and found that when it was hot and humid, I couldn’t walk the courses like I had always done as my lungs were so messed up I had trouble breathing. I walked off a few courses in the middle of rounds which I’ve never done.  Later that summer, I was in a much cooler area and had no problems so it seems to be some issues with the heat and humidity.  Even just going for walks when it was hot was too much.

Also, her best friend who is a school nurse sat next to her at a wedding right after we got home.  She came down with the same thing we had about 10 days later. She also said it was the worst thing she’d had. She had all the correct shots at the time.

We’ll probably never know, but looking back on it a few months later we sure felt like it might have been COVID.

Tomorrow I’m getting my first vaccination.  Hopefully I’ll be a lot safer soon, but I won’t know until this summer if I’m still suffering from the after effects of whatever I had.",science
"Researchers have developed a new method to counter emergent mutations of the coronavirus and hasten vaccine development to stop the pathogen responsible for ruining the economy and killing thousands of people.

Using artificial intelligence (AI), the research team at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering developed a method to speed the analysis of vaccines and zero in on the best potential preventive medical therapy.

The method is easily adaptable to analyze potential mutations of the virus, ensuring the best possible vaccines are quickly identified — solutions that give humans a big advantage over the evolving contagion. Their machine-learning model can accomplish vaccine design cycles that once took months or years in a matter of seconds and minutes, the study says.

“This AI framework, applied to the specifics of this virus, can provide vaccine candidates within seconds and move them to clinical trials quickly to achieve preventive medical therapies without compromising safety,” said Paul Bogdan, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at USC Viterbi and corresponding author of the study. “Moreover, this can be adapted to help us stay ahead of the coronavirus as it mutates around the world.”

The findings appear today in Nature Research’s Scientific Reports.

"A general problem I have with this kind of statistical forecast is that it's quite difficult to know exactly what is being forecast. The authors claim that their main forecast depicts a scenario in which no additional policy changes are introduced, but their method effectively involves extrapolating recent emission/carbon intensity trends, which have been influenced by an increase in climate policy over the past 10-20 years.

In other words, their forecast surely inherently assumes an increase in policy. In fact, it's generally understood that climate policy has diminishing returns so linear emissions reduction requires an exponential increase in policy, which suggests that their forecast is dependent on exponentially increasing policy over time.",science

>We here consider the relationship between workplace gender measures and employees’ perceived job quality, where the former cover both the gender mix of workers with the same job title and the gender of the immediate boss. Data from the 2015 European Working Conditions Survey show that men’s job evaluation is higher in gender-balanced job positions at the workplace, while that of women is higher in either gender-balanced or male-dominated positions. The gender of the immediate boss plays no significant role in employee job evaluation. There is some evidence that these correlations differ by job-quality domains. We introduce co-worker support and help, gender discrimination, and unwanted sexual attention as possible mediators of the gender-mix correlations: these change the estimated coefficients only little. Our estimated correlations could therefore reflect a pure preference for job-position gender composition. Last, we use a bounding approach to show that our main results are robust to the potential influence of unobservables. Overall, job-position gender diversity is associated with higher worker well-being.",science

"# Abstract
Direct electrical stimulation can modulate the activity of brain networks for the treatment of several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders and for restoring lost function. However, precise neuromodulation in an individual requires the accurate modelling and prediction of the effects of stimulation on the activity of their large-scale brain networks. Here, we report the development of dynamic input–output models that predict multiregional dynamics of brain networks in response to temporally varying patterns of ongoing microstimulation. In experiments with two awake rhesus macaques, we show that the activities of brain networks are modulated by changes in both stimulation amplitude and frequency, that they exhibit damping and oscillatory response dynamics, and that variabilities in prediction accuracy and in estimated response strength across brain regions can be explained by an at-rest functional connectivity measure computed without stimulation. Input–output models of brain dynamics may enable precise neuromodulation for the treatment of disease and facilitate the investigation of the functional organization of large-scale brain networks.",science

Abstract: Human emotional weeping, or crying, occurs in response to a wide array of antecedents. Although music is often mentioned specifically as a stimulus that may make individuals cry, few studies have systematically explored the characteristics of these crying episodes. The present study examines crying over music. Participants (*N* = 2778; 1716 women) completed a survey asking about the last time they cried while listening to music, their associated emotions and physical experiences, details of the song they were listening to, time of day, presence of others, and the overall experience of the crying episode itself. Crying over music appears to be relatively common and occurs mainly when the person is alone during the afternoon and evening. Participants cried over a wide variety of songs, and they attributed their crying to sad memories, nostalgia, the music itself, and the lyrics. They often experienced being moved, sadness, powerlessness, and nostalgia while crying over music. These findings are discussed in the context of music listening and how they compare with the findings of research on crying in general.",science

Abstract

BACKGROUND. Immunization with replication-competent recombinant vectors provides exposure to transgene-encoded antigens in the context of inflammation that may drive more potent and durable immunity compared to non-replicating vaccines. To understand the features of a replicating vaccine that drive such responses we tested a replication-competent adenovirus type 4 encoding influenza virus H5 hemagglutinin (Ad4-H5-Vtn) administered by an oral capsule or via a tonsillar swab or nasal spray.

METHODS. Viral shedding from the nose, mouth, and rectum was measured by PCR and culture. H5-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were measured by bead array binding assays. Serum antibodies were measured by a pseudovirus entry inhibition assay (PVEI), microneutralization (MN), and hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI).

RESULTS. Ad4-H5-Vtn DNA was shed from most upper respiratory tract (URT)-immunized volunteers for 2-4 weeks, but cultured from only 60% of participants with a median duration of one day. Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccination induced increases in H5-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood and IgG and IgA in nasal, cervical and rectal secretions. URT immunizations induced high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to H5 which remained stable at week 26. The duration of viral shedding correlated with the magnitude of the NAb response at week 26. Adverse events (AE) were mild, and peak NAb titer was associated with overall AE frequency or duration. Serum neutralizing antibody titers could be boosted to very high levels 2-5 years after Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccination with recombinant H5 or inactivated split H5N1 vaccine.

Abstract:

>Daytime napping is a common, heritable behavior, but its genetic basis and causal relationship with cardiometabolic health remain unclear. Here, we perform a genome-wide association study of self-reported daytime napping in the UK Biobank (*n*?=?452,633) and identify 123 loci of which 61 replicate in the 23andMe research cohort (*n*?=?541,333). Findings include missense variants in established drug targets for sleep disorders (*HCRTR1*, *HCRTR2*), genes with roles in arousal (*TRPC6*, *PNOC*), and genes suggesting an obesity-hypersomnolence pathway (*PNOC, PATJ*). Association signals are concordant with accelerometer-measured daytime inactivity duration and 33 loci colocalize with loci for other sleep phenotypes. Cluster analysis identifies three distinct clusters of nap-promoting mechanisms with heterogeneous associations with cardiometabolic outcomes. Mendelian randomization shows potential causal links between more frequent daytime napping and higher blood pressure and waist circumference.",science

"By late summer 2020, the resurgence of COVID-19 in the United States was largely driven by adults between the ages of 20 and 49, a new study finds. The results indicate that in locations where novel highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 lineages have not yet established, additional interventions among adults of these ages could bring resurgent COVID-19 epidemics under control and avert deaths. Following initial declines in the number of reported SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths - a result largely attributed to non-pharmaceutical interventions - a resurgence in transmission of COVID-19 occurred in the United States and Europe beginning in August 2020. Understanding the age demographics that drove this is crucial. For example, between August and October 2020, school closure mandates were lifted in many United States locations. Whether the resurgent epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 during 2020 can be explained by students going back to school has been an open question.

Part of the authors' approach involved analyzing aggregated, age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals' cell phones.

"By looking at the specs ( processor & ram ), all the three are pretty good in terms of performance. So, we must concentrate on other things ( storage, display quality, design etc. )

Storage - Asus & XPS i710th gen has sufficient storage. But if we consider that you won't be buying any external storage in near future, I will probably pick the Asus one due to its massive storage. Or the XPS 10th Gen but I would avoid 11th Gen ( 256 is too less IMO )

Display - In this case, we can't really argue which one is the best since the display is kinda subjective ( beauty is in the eyes of beholder ). All of them are in high end, so I will assume that they are kinda good. Going with the specs, I will pick the Asus because it has OLED and Dell has IPS on both. And you probably know why OLED is better.

Design - XPS can be called the "" Macs of Windows "". The extremely thin bezels, edge to edge keyboard, large trackpad & the simple back design are a reason why it looks like Macs. Asus has its own spin to it. The brand logo is offcentre and it has a concentric circle design which looks amazing. The bezels can be little bit big. One good thing about both of them is that they are metallic build which feels premium. I can't say much about color because that's your choice.

Ports - Asus - 1 HDMI, 2 Type C & 1 Type A.  Dell - 2 USB Type C, 1 3.5mm jack,1 microSD card reader. To be honest, both are really less. I believe that both may provide external usb ports. In Asus side, it will provide 3.5 mm jack dongle. I'm not sure what Dell will provide. So the choices of ports are really limited on both.

Conclusion - Go for Asus as it has a better value in other factors ( as mentioned ). Dell are also a viable options. They aren't bad in any case ( they just get a little bit behind Asus ). In terms of performance alone, you won't regret choosing any of them. But in others, the judgement will slightly slide towards the Asus. 

I hope that you have got an idea which to choose. Take care, be healthy and have a happy new year ( in advance ) !!!",laptop

Well these are the choices that I could find for now. I could find more for you but the problem is that I really don't know which websites Canadians shop at. So can you list some sites from where I could search. The Amazon Ca had really limited choices.

One tip that I want to say that don't go for chromebook as they have less storage. They are good but storage is really limiting.

For now, IMO, I would prefer to go for the Asus Laptops ( choice 2,3 or 5 ). They have good storage and have that sweet Ryzen processor which is currently hot in the tech world. Acer is also kinda good.

I also want to indulge in casual gaming (fifa mostly, but if I could play rdr2 would be nice ofc. Mostly am fond of older titles). 
Besides this, I'll mostly use it for netflix and other general stuff. 

A hybrid drive is a must (because obviously will need an ssd, but in this budget won't get bigger storage than 512, which will not be enough). 

My budget is ~75-80k in INR (1017-1080$ at the time of writing this post)
Ideally would like to make this laptop last for 4-5 years at the least. 

Any help would be appreciated",laptop
"I narrowed my search down to 2 laptops that I should purchase. I actually ended up buying both to lock in the sale price, but will return one of them once I make a decision. Screen size doesn’t matter a whole lot to me, I just want a half decent battery and something that’s going to last a few years. All I really do is browse the web, run basic apps (Spotify, discord) and play light games (Minecraft or similar.) the hp comes with 8gb of ram which I would immediately upgrade to 16gb, I’m just struggling on if I should get the 11th gen i5 or stick with the 10th gen on the HP. Both were purchased on sale for around the same price (less than $100 difference) although the dell was an open box and the HP was new.

"Hello from Asia !

The laptop you chose is a good choice for its price. Well, I tried to look up on Amazon Au but the choices were limited so I didn't choose any from there. I looked up at from B&H site. It's an american site with worldwide shipping ( although some models are not deliverable in my area )

So here are my choices. 

1. [HP ProBook x360 435 G7](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1566218-REG/hp_17g38ut_aba_x360_435_g7_ryz7.html)
2. [Asus ZenBook Flip 13](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1597794-REG/asus_ux363ea_xh71t_13_3_fhd_i7_1165g7_16gb_lpddr4x_512gb_pcie.html/qa)
3. [Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 9](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1601565-REG/lenovo_82d2000bus_id_slim_9_i7_1165g7.html/overview)

One thing that I can't really confirm is whether they do ship the stylus of their respective models or not from that site. They do have touchscreen support & also include stylus ( mentioned in their maker's site ) but this is like Amazon. So before you buy ( if you are going to buy from there ) check whether they will bundle with it or not. If not, then check whether you can buy the stylus separately or not.

All these laptops ( including the Acer ) have a powerful processor, good display & ample amount of storage. So even if you aren't going to buy from the list mentioned, you won't possibly regret the choice that you've already made.

Have a good day ( and an advanced merry christmas !! )",laptop

And then move your programs, games (if you have enough space for that) to gain boost in performance.

I recently bought a MSI GS66 laptop 240HZ 1080p 16GB RAM, RTX 2060 i7-10750h, NVME 1TB for $1999.99 CAD as sale on November 30, 2020. 

Upgraded it 32GB RAM and added NVME 1TB. 

Frames of games are fine and I only play Apex, Warzone (I lock them to 190 FPS)  other shooters too like Overwatch, even Diablo III that reaches above 240 to fully use the screen which is so smooth. I play some indie games which I'm not worry about. as those goes beyond 1000 frames. And used for just normal surfing on web and such.   


Now they announced RTX 30 series releasing this January 26, 2021. I really want to upgrade but is it worth it though? Prices are really low for them and I can return my laptop to Bestbuy till January 16 with full refund.

"While its hard to compare the two directly, I can tell you that the HP Pavilion x360 is best avoided. It's a rather poor chassis from both a build and thermal perspective.

Single device solutions tend to come with compromises so I'm not sure if an iPad + regular laptop wouldn't be a better fit, particularly as you'd get more performance/value out of the laptop. Both the M1 Macs and Windows options are worth considering.

**TL:DR**

7 year old laptop, new thermal paste, recently cleaned fan, disconnected battery, suddenly powering off under load.

**Specs:**

* Lenovo Flex 2 - 15 inch variant
* i5 4210U
* GeForce 840M
* 240 GB SSD
* 1 TB HDD *(replaced Disk Drive with HDD Caddy)*
* 12 GB RAM *(4 originally, added 8)*

**Solutions Tried:**

* New Thermal Paste
* Cleaned Fans
* Disconnected and reconnected battery
* Set everything to use Integrated GPU rather than the 840M

**Long Version:**

My modified laptop is around 5/6/7 years old. I love it. It survived everything I threw at it. Games? Handles it like it you’d expect. A tad over 60FPS no more than 80FPS (conditional). Editing? Handles 60FPS 1080P.. with restrictions. This afternoon it started powering off suddenly whenever I load up games. I’ve disconnected it’s battery, changed it’s thermal paste and cleaned out it fan. Nothing worked. Any Ideas? Is it time to say farewell to my old friend?",laptop

"If you're looking at computers with an MSRP below $1000 USD, you will almost definitely be looking at 8GB of RAM, because that's all that most users can and ever will need (outside of specialized use cases).

I always explain RAM like a cup. If I need to water my plants outside with tap water from the kitchen, and I know I need 6oz. of water, if I only have a 4oz. cup, I'm not going to be able to carry all the water I need. Conversely, if I have an 8oz. cup, I'm not going to use all of it to transport the amount of water I need. It doesn't particularly matter how much bigger my cup is, if I've got a 16oz. cup but only need 6oz. of water, I'm carrying a comically large cup for no reason aside from potentially needing 9oz. of water a few years from now.

Your average workload on a computer is ~.5GB RAM dedicated to graphics, ~2.5GB for Windows, ~1GB to background applications (Antivirus, system monitors, device/driver software, etc), and ~2-3GB of foreground tasks (2-3 documents, 4-6 Edge tabs, and youtube or music in the background). (Adds up to about 7GB.)

Unless you have specific needs above that (such as gaming, development software, virtual machines, design software, content creation, etc) you likely won't run I to many circumstances where 8GB isn't enough.

If you still think you need more memory, you may need to increase your budget or look specifically into computers that allow for more upgradability.",laptop
"Your requirements conflict with each other, that's why it's difficult to find the right stuff for you. You don't care about thin and light, and also want dedicated graphics, but you want 13"".

Most 13-14"" laptops are built to be light weight, so they usually skip dedicated graphics. Dedicated graphics requires good cooling, which needs more space and is easier to accommodate in bigger laptops. Not to mention the space required for the graphics card itself.

"I have a Toshiba Satellite L550 and it is 11 years old.  Over the years I have upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, and replaced the battery a few times. The newest replacement was about 3 months ago.  
I have been using my laptop quite a lot over the past 3 months, several hours on a daily basis. I've noticed that it would get VERY VERY hot underneath, and when this happened I would plug in a usb powered fan which sits underneath the laptop. This seemed to cool it down. I should point out that I never got an overheat error message, nor did the laptop ever shut down from being over heated. The laptop would be at its hottest when both the powersupply was charging the battery and when I had a usb bluetooth dongle connected.   


It was working fine yesterday morning, I put the screen down for a while, but when I returned it wouldn't display anything.   
I switched it off, turned it back on again and now the fan powers on for about 2 seconds and then stops, the motherboard stays on but I have no display.  Here's what I've tried so far:  


\- Connecting the laptop to an external display. The external display won't even register that anything is connected. I've tried holding the fn key and pressing F5 twice, but I can't even get that far into startup.

\- Removed the hdd, battery and RAM and tried a hard reset, pressed the power button a bunch of times and then held it down for 30 seconds, connected the power supply but that didn't solve it.

\- Tried with one stick of RAM.

\- Removed the fan and there was A LOT of dirt in there, an entire blanket between the fan and heatsink. So that explains why it was running very hot.

\- I've tried to isolate the problem by removing physical connections one by one, but nothing makes a difference. The power comes on, the fan starts instantly, stops after 2 seconds and then nothing, but the power remains turned on, so I don't think it's a power issue.

\- I don't believe that this has anything to do with this, but I would occassionaly get a PXE error on startup, test media cable or something. I think this is just from the boot sequence when I was installing windows 10 via usb. Just thought I'd mention it anyway.  


&#x200B;

My guess is that the overheating may have caused the thermal paste under the CPU to loosen/crack, so I'm going to clean them now and apply new paste.  


If that doesn't work, then maybe the graphics chip is done for, and I've heard that you cannot replace them in Toshiba Satellites, so this could be the end of the road for this laptop....  


I would appreciate any info advice on this. I've just began the second semester of college from home, so this is a bit of a nightmare.",laptop
"Hey Guys, sorry if this is a common question.

&#x200B;

My wife's got an old laptop (ay011nr) that's got all the specs I need, but she dropped it a ton and there's some bleaching on the screen. What I would love to do is buy a non-working one from someone else and put all my innerds into that one (so basically, a new shell + screen). Is there a way to find those kinds of parts easily? I also imagine that most people have issues with the screen breaking more than anything so the search might be in vain anyways. TIA",laptop

Only CyberPowerPC has the Ryzen processor ( Ryzen 7 4000 Series )

Others have either 11th Gen Intel or 10th Gen Intel. All are i7 tho.

MSI Summit & Asus ZenBook has integrated Intel Graphics. Intel Xe Graphics ( not the old UHD graphics ). Others have either GTX 1650 ( 4 GB ) or RTX 2060 ( 6 GB ).

These are some of the machines that I picked up. If you can find it in your local dealer with similar price or lower, then buy from there. If not, then you can find it online and buy from there.

"Hi reddit.

So I recently bought a laptop from a friend. I know little about laptops (let alone buying online) so when she gave me the specs I assumed it’s working just fine. It’s still in good condition tho it’s just super slow when it boots up.

I wanna upgrade it so I can use it for acad and gaming purposes. I also wanna buy accessories like wireless headphones, cooling pads, etc.

Here’s my laptop’s specs according to my friend. If anyone could suggest any upgrades then that would be super great. U can also include the cost so i can check my budget 

• Lenovo ideapad 100-14IBY
• Processor: Intel Core i3 1.83GHz
• 4GB RAM(Upgradeable)
• 500GB HDD and 128 SSD
• 64-bit operating system
• Windows 10 Home Single Language, Installed last 03/27/2020",laptop

"So I have an acer aspire 5. I recently sent it in for repair to replace to the motherboard. They replaced it. Today, I started hearing a weird high pitched kind of electrical noise.

It doesn't occur under any kind of load, if I do more intensive tasks the sound doesn't increase/decrease compared to when I do non-intensive tasks. The sound lasts about 3 seconds, and occurs every 30-45 seconds. Any advice on what I should do? Is it just coil whine, or is it a more serious issue that I should be concerned about?

"Hello, i really need help with a Lenovo legion 5 decide.
They are two models

The gtx model are a little bit cheaper but it's very small the price differences.

-Rayzen 5 4600h and rtx 2060 (80wh battery, 16gb ram, 512 gb pci express storage and 144hz refresh rate)
-Rayzen 7 4800h and gtx 1660ti (all same expect the refresh rate , here only 60hz.....)

I saw the 4600h is more cooler then the 4800h. I will buy this laptop for long term
(i know i need to wait for the rtx 3000 series but if they will be over priced i will buy between this two model). 

Battery life is important for me ( only on idle mode, i know it can be stay on 12 hours but i don't know the differences between then here)

I'm not a big competitive player but for long term i think the 144hz is more important. 

My question is the 4600h is enough for the rtx card?(btw i don't know 80w or 115w version).

"If you want a ryzen 5000 series laptop, then the word ""wait"" is the only answer. No one really knows when it will arrive but they are not going to be that cheap when it comes fresh.

Okay ... now talking about the main topic here.

Just by only looking at specs & comparing with the price, I will go for the Lenovo or the Dell.

Lenovo has R5 with 16 gigs at 650 while Dell has R7 at 780 and Asus has R5 with 750 ( compared to Dell, Asus seems overpriced )

Here's a review of the Dell by another redditor [Review of Dell Inspiron 14](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDLaptops/comments/i5r4yt/indepth_review_dell_inspiron_14_5405_with_4700u/) . IDK whether the machine that you are looking for is as same as that review but the specs may seem similiar. I read the review and there's only one thing that I can say - Well Written & Unbiased. So you can trust that review.

Lenovo has good processor and has extra ram and also at a less price. So for the sake of saving money, I would go for Ideapad. But for a little bit more, you can go for the Dell. It has a better processor and although it has 8 gigs of ram but you can later install more ram ( according to that review ). Asus may look overpriced but as a Zenbook & Vivobook owner, I can say that they make the device feel premium and has that screenpad which may become useful ( if properly used ). It has the numeric pad on the touchpad itself which is a good thing to have since most laptops have no dedicated numberpad. The only thing that forbids me to recommends this is that it feels overpriced and also some models have removed the 3.5mm jack ( don't worry. They bundle that adapter for that ).

So in conclusion, these devices are good but go for Lenovo or Dell.

Anymore questions/queries ? Feel free to ask !",laptop
I'm looking for a laptop with a Ryzen 4000 series graphics card. I can't find one anywhere in my budget. My cap is around $500 but I can likely go $20 more if I find a really good one.

"Hi, thank you for taking the time to read this.  I need either a recommendation for a Laptop or a recommendation for a comparison website where I can search for my requirements.

Main requirements:  
1) Keyboard that is backlit so I can type on the couch.  
2) Matte screen so it is readable in daylight.  
3) Long battery run time  
4) Able to run (vanilla) Linux. NOT Windows, NOT ChromeOS.   
5) Decent touchpad with multi-touch (are there even any without these days?)  
6) Full HD or better, 14"" or 15""  


Nice2Have but not super important:  
Wifi6, SD-Reader  


Not so important: CPU or GPU power and storage capacity. I'm using this more like a mobile ThinClient honestly. I would even go for a ARM SOC based Laptop is that is available (and if the trade-off gives me other advantages like for example long battery life or a cheaper price).

"Currently looking at purchasing my first laptop from XotciPc, I’ve tossed around so many ideas that I eventually landed there and tryin to get something ordered. Primary use will be schooling purposes as well as gaming possibly some photo editing. 

They offer a few additional cooling options and I’m just curious to the benefits and if these options are worth investing in. 
I’m undecided on what i may go with but my Current build I’m interested in is:

Sager NP8358F-S
15.6” 144Hz display
RTX 2070 super
32GB RAM
1TB WD BLUE M.2 PCIE NVME SSD

The option of adding IC diamond or kryonaut seem necessary and I plan on ether doing that my self or just having XPC do it. 

*here’s the part I’m unsure of. 
They have and option for applying Fujipoly to heat sensitive areas and an option that says they would apply extra copper heatsinks to the heatpipes. 

Would ether of these options be beneficial for longevity of the laptop as well as performance and would more experienced builders recommend them? I’m also curious if allowing XPC to open the laptop to apply thermal paste and other options would void Sagers warranty. 
Thanks.",laptop

In short, 875 has little gain in performance compared to 750. Extra 2 cores and 8MB extra cache for multitasking processes. So, if the budget allows then go for 875 one. Either way, both are powerful. But, going with only pure performance, I will go for 875 one.",laptop

"I've had a laptop for the last year or so and I finally got around to fixing it finally because it was unusable, As the clocked rolled over to 12am making it Christmas morning I managed to fix it and make it usable again,

it's a hp probook 650 g3 with 4g of ram, 256g SSD, a dual core I5 at 2,71 GHz with some sort if integrated graphics.

I just found out external graphics cards are a thing and u can plug them into an outlet and connect them to your laptop to play more graphically intensive games.

for most of these do I need access to to bios? it has some sort of card slot near the power outlet that i assume it connects to.(express slot I think?

any recommendations, ideas or comments?

"I've had both Windows and Mac computers in the past, and while I've enjoyed the customization options that Windows offers and the accessibility to so many different programs, its susceptibility to crashing ALL THE TIME is really starting to get on my nerves.

I've had a Mobile Studio Pro for awhile now, and unfortunately, it's a tablet computer known to have a very short life span. The first time around, it lasted 3 years and then basically died, and I was lucky enough to have Wacom just send me a new one. I'd get some blue screens every few months or some weird driver issues, and I'm usually patient enough to work through them and go through many articles and try a bunch of different things for days. But I'm on a restart loop again for over a day now, getting blue screened every time the computer turns on. First it was a video error for awhile, then it kept saying ""critical process died"". Tried at least 10 different methods from what I read online (couldn't even try most of the things I read though since it won't even let me run the computer for more than a few seconds before restarting again). Even when I went ""screw it"" and just told it to reset Windows and reinstall everything from scratch, I got error messages just saying, ""we ran into a problem, no changes were made"". It gives me very little options in terms of trying alternatives. Most cmd scans also just gave me errors, and it would just say it couldn't do it and not give me a reason why.

I really miss Macs and how effortlessly they ran without me having sudden problems because I didn't update X driver or Y program suddenly ruined everything or just because it was moody that day. However, I'm on a very tight budget, and I just want a simple computer that can fit my needs without breaking the bank.

I'm changing careers, so I no longer need the expensive Mobile Studio Pro. I considered resetting it (if it'll let me...) and selling it, and using the money to get a new, cheaper computer. I wanted to do art streams (using LonelyScreen or something similar to get the image from my iPad), so all I really need is 8gb RAM, and some sort of USB port. A clean design would be nice if possible (not a fan of most bulky gamer laptops and how they look, but hey, beggars can't be choosers). 

I'd love something cheap or cheapish (I don't mind going up to 1k or so, but I'd love to stay below that if possible), but I'm not sure if I can avoid Windows 10, since it's what seems to be my problem. Every time I search up solutions, every article seems to say ""this is a common Windows 10 issue!"" for major issues like being on a restart loop and just not functioning at all. I just want to run Photoshop/some equivalent, stream art, and do things like Netflix Parties and Discord chats with friends. Is there an option out there that's both within my budget and NOT subject to Windows 10 and its iffyness?",laptop
"I bought an MSI GL65 10SFK-062 two days ago. This is my first laptop.

Laptop specs: i7 10750H 2.6GHz, RTX 2070 8GB, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, 144 Hz

I tried to play Horizon Zero Dawn today and I was monitoring the CPU temperature while playing. I was playing with everything on ultra settings with fps capped at 70 fps.

The laptop performance was good as I was getting a constant 70 FPS. But the fans were going crazy and the CPU temperature was constantly in mid 80s°C. Once or twice, it even hit 90°C. The GPU temperature seemed fine as it was around 70s constantly. I checked temperature on MSI Dragon Centre as well as HWMonitor. I had no background apps running except steam and xbox.

I live in a cold place with temperatures being -5°C outside but around 25°C in my room. 

I checked on the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility and it says that my laptop was on average, thermal throttling.

I can power the laptop with quad core i7-2670qm on ASUS A43SV, but when I change the power plan to entertainment or higher, the battery doesn't hold and just shutdown itself. 

So yeah. It worth the price anyway. I just consider it as a gas bill. (Gas bill for myself a month only worth 5 bucks, I'm living in SEA - Indonesia, so yeah, it's quite pricey, for 3 times my gas cost for a month)",laptop

"Please stay away from asus. It really have alot of broken case, broken hinge, etc etc in past year. I don't know why they become worst.

I still own an old asus laptop, they're great, but nowdays asus, I doubt it.. 

Stay with LG or Dell, or HP. 

If you are willing to take risk with acer, then go. 

ACER mobo and some component are manufactured by asus, and their quality is below asus TBH. I don't know why the company still exist.

"16 maybe. It actually depends how you will use. IMO, I use my laptops for light use and I am quite okay with 8GB ram. 

More the ram, more better it is. Although it may be pricey but it's better to have more ( especially as you can't install extra ram on M1 ). And since you are a Comp. Sc. student, so lots of coding, projects, etc. and in the upcoming year or 2, you will multitask so I guess that it will be safer to go for 16GB.  If you are going for light tasks such as Youtube, Reddit, Music, Movies & Light Games, it is fine to have only 8GB RAM. In other cases such as Lr, FCP, Coding, etc. , go for the 16GB.

And speaking of selling it, well you can sell it about 20% less than the original price ( if maintained pretty well ), if not ... then maybe 40\~60 % less.

"Hi!

I was wondering if anybody could give me some advice on laptops!

About a year ago I purchased a Lenovo L340 Gaming laptop, which while awesome, didn't really work for college and my job since the battery life is awful. Also, I may or may not have f'cked up the cooling while cleaning it out, which means it's now basically a toaster oven.

Since that purchase however, I've settled down in a more permanent place which means I no longer need a portable 'gaming machine', since I now have a desktop setup for that. And while I'm not going out a lot right now *(obviously)* My employer has scheduled me abroad for the next summer season, and I need a laptop for that, as well as college in september, since I'm switching schools, and hopefully we'll be able to have 'normal' classes again by then.

So I was wondering if you guys know of any laptops that meet these use cases/wishes:

\- General spreadsheet/browsing/emailing and other office stuff. For college, as well as work.

\- Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere work. I don't use premiere all day, but I would like to be able to at least somewhat smoothly edit my footage when I'm abroad. Photoshop and Illustrator do really have to run without a hitch, since that's like 80% of my college and 40% of my job.

\- Good / Great battery life. Of course if I'm editing 4k 120fps footage or whatever *(which I'm not expecting at all)* I'm gonna have to plug in quite soon, but if my day consists mostly of word documents and excell sheets, I'd like it to go for a good while without needing to go and find a socket.

\- Preferably Windows. I've been looking at Macbooks a lot, especially with the new M1 models, but I'm baked into the Windows and Google ecosystems so much, I don't know if I'm ready for the challenge of switching yet...

\- Thinner and lighter. So, my gaming laptop is really chunky and heavy. Now, that's no problem when it's sitting on a desk, but when you're walking around campus all day with the thing in a backpack, it gets heavy FAST. So I'd like it to be reasonably thin and light. I know this is directly opposite performance, but there has to be some holy middle ground right?

&#x200B;

So, I know this is a lot to ask for a laptop, and of course I'm willing to make sacrifices here and there to achieve other points on my list, but I'm secretly hoping for someone to offer a middle ground solution!

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading at least! And if you have any suggestions at all please throw 'em my way!

i have a low end laptop that can play pre 2012 games

i have asked this question based on knowing two points for battery longevity 

1) keeping laptop battery between 80% to 20% is a good habit.

&#x200B;

2) always plug you laptop while gaming

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

so do i need to charge to 80% then disconnect and again charge at 20% battery during gaming

The reason is the SSD  on the dell and not on Lenovo. Lenovo has more space but that has HDD. And the HDD compared to SSD, it's very slow. 

If we keep all the specifications same but one laptop has HDD & other one has SSD, the SSD laptop will come out as the winner. That laptop will feel faster and snappier.

If you can find a refurbished laptop with a 500GB/512GB SSD, that will be even great. But for now ( considering your list ), I suggest you to go for the Dell Latitude.

Second is when I put the computer to sleep or when it automatically locks down, I am unable to wake it with any keys. The screen just go off and never turn on again. I face the same problem as the previous issue. The blue led is on but the display doesnt turn on until the power is drained.

In case if I have connected the laptop with power supply, the battery never drains and the laptop dont shut down at all.

I took it to an authorised service center and they couldnt fix my problem. They just did the bios update and mentioned me that it's fixed. Unluckily I couldn't recreate the problem. on the day I got it fixed. It seems like they too dont have an answer or fix when I took it second time.

"Laptops have more demands for long. And nowadays, laptops offer high-quality processing power and skill to control capability and still high-end gaming. However, size matters comparing to computers. Comparing with laptops, users can get more power, higher graphics, and more user extensibility for desktop.

As a gamer, users probably could use more space for a graphics card, more hard drives and RAM. Users sometimes think to change or upgrade something used for long, but it’s so complicated for the laptop to do it.

When users purchase a desktop computer, they need to envisage all the usual parts they envisage for buying another computer that begins with processing power. A powerful processor can run computer smoothly without any crushes. The RAM also plays an important role in that if users plan for multitasking and gaming or any other activities where the computer need rapid access to memories belonged with that software.  
There are also more envisages. As a gamer, users need to purchase a stable graphics card to run the game smoothly. And to make sure that there have enough ports and structured that support user’s style.

"Unless you’re doing highly compute-intensive work (you would know if you were, and you aren’t), more RAM is *always* the correct choice.  Unless you were talking i7 vs. i3 or a really low-end CPU, then *maybe* the i7 would be helpful since it has more cores and much higher clock speeds. The only difference between current-gen i5 and i7 is cache size and a tiny max clock speed advantage, neither of which will be noticeable in “general use” workloads.  Get the RAM, especially since more and more laptops can’t be upgraded later.",laptop
"I just bought a laptop 3 days ago(MSI GS66) , the connection seems to be bad when I am upstairs, my router provides an Internet speed of 300mbps but when I am upstairs the speed received by my laptop  is only 70mbps . But when I get few feet away from my router, I can get full speed. 
The problem is, my previous laptop (triton 300 2060 model) can get up to 200+mbps anywhere in my house. Even right now my phone has 2x the speed despite being in the same place as my laptop.

Another issue I face is disconnecting in games, as I previously mentioned my speed is 70mbps,(5 ping) I assume that playing any games should be fine, however, when I launch apex legends(origin) my Internet DISCONNECTS on its own, it literally just disconnects everything,  this happens with battlefront too, but when I play world of warships the speed seems fine and the ping is low,
when I move downstairs  where the speed is stronger(300mbps), my game launches properly and dosent cause my Internet to disconnect (weird!!?!?!)
Althoufh both speeds are supposed to be playable (300 and 70)  with low ping too. 

Apart from that, YouTube Facebook discord and everything else runs fine without any problems.

If someone were to know the issue or has faced it before  please help me or guide me thank you.

"NOTE - In my country, LG isn't known for its laptop ( although it can be bought ) so I really can't say how good their laptops will be in general. So this will be a little biased unless someone comments here who has personally used LG laptops.

&#x200B;

I think you should get the ASUS laptop because it has larger storage ( 512gb vs 1tb ) and has that screenpad which may be useful in certain cases. It has mx250 which is kinda better than the intel integrated graphics on LG. I am not sure how the graphics will be useful for data analysis but still I think better graphics will serve one day.

One thing that LG has a advantage is its 2in1 capability. It can be folded easily and has that stylus pen to work with it. Asus has that touchscreen but it doesn't have that 2in1 capability nor has the stylus pen.

Both are pretty slim, powerful ( in its range ), good looking and has good battery life. So the main differentiator is the storage ( as far as I could find ). And yeah there's a price difference between the two but since you are looking at them so I believe that the price difference won't be worth debating here.

I hope this helps & if you have any more questions you can still ask. ( I may reply late but I will answer )",laptop

"Hello. I opened up my Acer laptop to clean the fan and radiator. After putting it back together and running World of Tanks I noticed my CPU frequency throttled to 400 MHz. 

I downloaded ThrottleStop and it shows BD PROCHOT red under Core and GPU. When I look straight down in the game the CPU ramps up to 3.4 GHz, but when many objects are rendered it drops to 400 MHz. Intel XTU said the CPU is thermal throttling, but the temps never went over 60.

Now, when I disable Turbo Boost in ThrottleStop, the CPU runs stably at 1.6 GHz. 

The battery is completely dead and has been so for some time. I also removed it after the throttling issue started, but it didn't affect the issue.

If you consider the processor & the graphics card, then it is a huge performance difference. Especially GPU performance. First the Ray Tracing will be present on 2060. Second is that the performance gain will be huge if you use the 2060. Third is that lot of games/graphics dependent softwares will perform better on 2060. And last is that since 2060 is newer compared to 1660ti, so lot of developers will focus on 2060 for updates, maintenance & development on better performance for softwares running on 2060. 1660ti will become outdated once rtx 30xx & 40xx ( if they keep up with the naming ) laptops arrives.

If you are using it for heavy gaming or heavy cpu or gpu work using a cooling pas can help. Even the best laptop coolers aren’t ideal. As long as the flow direction matches your laptop it will help.  If the flow direction doesn’t match you can use it with the fans off as just getting that extra space will help the flow and keep your crotch cooler.

I want something with atleast 8GB RAM, prefer 16 GB the RAM should be expandable

Require minimum 512GB SSD should be NVME and expandable

Dedicated graphics card is a plus

and i prefer AMD since they are cheaper however recommendations for both intel and AMD are welcome

Thanks in advance for your time

Edit: Guys i know things are very overpriced in India but please suggest me something meeting atleast 50% of my requirements i can only increase my budget by max 5-10k INR (about 100 USD)",laptop
"Need help with purchasing a laptop
Hey everyone :)

Long story short I have a work laptop but need a second laptop for everyday use and was wondering if anyone could help me out.

I’m looking for a second laptop for some casual photography editing and to be able to handle the odd game like Age of empire's

My cousin is selling his Dell XPS 9360 for £600 which has rarely been used what so ever. Was wondering if this is a good option or should I look for a new laptop around that price range ?",laptop
"Laptop: [MSI GL65 Leopard 10SFK-062 15.6”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085B3GFRL?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)

So I got this laptop, and by default it has 512GB of storage. I’ve used up about 80% of it, so I decide to finally install [this 5TB SeaGate hard drive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AADIX?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) in the laptops free slot, only to find out its too tall!

"Hi everyone, I hope I can make a decision between these 2 laptops with your help, as I'm really struggling with it right now.

I use my computer for working as a social media manager, so lots of SM, Word, Excel and Web browsing. 

I understood a 3:2 screen is ideal for this usage but I intend to work mostly with an external monitor alongside the notebook one, and I think the Huawei shows black sidebars on a regular 16:9 external screen, that's a big let down as I like everything about it (except the nose-webcam actually).

On the other side the MSI needs a ram upgrade and I'm not so sure about its screen quality and if it'll be noticeably worse than the Matebook for vertical space or if the bigger size makes up for it. I like the webcam position and overall sleek design though.

Specs are as follows:

Matebook 14 | R5 4600H/16GB 2660mhz/512GB
Modern 15 | i5 1135g7/8GB 3200mhz/512GB

"I'm looking to get new laptop for mainly photo editing and light video editing but also to play some games like rocket league and possibly some new AAA titles with medium graphics.

I think the Ryzen 7 4800h and rtx 2060 would provide me enough power for my requirements. I have found three possible candidates and would like to hear what you guys think, which one I should go with.

First one is Lenovo Legion. Though it fails to provide me enough ram and ssd space, they space can be upgraded later, but I don't really enjoy opening laptop cases much.

[https://www.currys.ie/ieen/gaming/pc-gaming/gaming-laptops/lenovo-legion-5p-15-6-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-rtx-2060-256-gb-ssd-10205989-pdt.html](https://www.currys.ie/ieen/gaming/pc-gaming/gaming-laptops/lenovo-legion-5p-15-6-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-rtx-2060-256-gb-ssd-10205989-pdt.html)

Second one I found is HP Omen 15, It has the specs I look for, but I have bad taste for HP from 15 years ago when all of their machines were breaking apart in half year. Also I've heard battery life being short in Omen laptops.

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-15-en0008na-GeForce-Dedicated-Graphics/dp/B0877LGCS6/ref=sr\_1\_1?dchild=1&keywords=ryzen%2B7%2B4800hs&qid=1610102680&refinements=p\_n\_feature\_browse-bin%3A21740491031&rnid=182781031&s=computers&sr=1-1&th=1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-15-en0008na-GeForce-Dedicated-Graphics/dp/B0877LGCS6/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=ryzen%2B7%2B4800hs&qid=1610102680&refinements=p_n_feature_browse-bin%3A21740491031&rnid=182781031&s=computers&sr=1-1&th=1)

And third one, Asus Zephyr with Ryzen 7 4800hs and gtx 1660ti. I've heard it having better battery life and for being a bit smaller and less weight, I'd have easier time taking it to field with me if needed. But is the 1660ti too much behind rtx 2060? And is the Asus price worth it over the HP?

"I got my Dell XPS15 in early 2019 and maxed out the RAM at 32GB and upped the NvME SSD to 1TB. I bought and added the upgrades on my own, so total price was around $1,500.  
I loved this little laptop for 2 years but it was just OK for gaming. It runs a 4k monitor for office apps, but not gaming. Low power mode its good for almost 6 HOURS!  


I picked up a Lenovo Legion on Black Friday for about $1,500. It has a dedicated graphics card and it feels much faster for gaming. The battery is WAY lower though, maybe about 4 hours in low power mode. Also, its really annoying that you cant turn off the RGB lights by default, so set a specific setting. On each reboot, the lights are in full demo mode - I would prefer something a bit more muted.  


If I am lucky I can sell my XPS15 for about $800. If thats the case - I get the equivalent of having a fairly high end laptop for about $250/year.  


**Lesson learned**: Dont cheap out and buy laptops for <$500 dollars. You will keep them for at least 2 years anyway and they wont be worth reselling. Your annual cost will be lower, but the performance is shit.

"If I were you, I wouldn't undervolt UNLESS you DEFINITELY know how to do it, here are a few safer suggestions to stop overheating:

- Turn bloom, motion blur and anti-aliasing off (you can turn anti-aliasing on if you want but lower it)

\- Buy a cooling pad

\- make sure the temps you are getting are correct, if you are getting frame spikes then that does mean it's overheating.

\- find a hard and smooth surface like a desk or a table

\- Make sure your intake fans have enough space to suck air in

\- check your fans are working properly and spinning to its max speed

"Hi all, I’m keen on gaming (Apex Legends, Warzone, etc), and I also want to use it for work as Ill be needing it to take notes, do research and study. I’m currently using an Omen 15 1050ti from 2018 but the RAM is having issues playing Apex (RAM is 8gb). 

Why I chose the Blade 15? Ideal size, sleek, doesn’t look like a gaming laptop, can pass off as looking professional, and the specs are pretty good.

"Hi! Im in a diffficult spot, i need a new laptop my current one broke. Im studying computer science and next year i will pick my major but i need a pc now/soon. Options are the blade 15 or stealth. OR the m1 mbp or waiting for the 14 inch or 16 inch models.

I need the laptop for school, league of legends or some games if im stranded away from my gaming rig but its not a becessity and overall things. 

I want power,  build quality and not having to be at a charger always. 

The problem is i wont know my major until next year. If i go into game dev i guess the blade would be better because of the gpu? Someone correct me if im wrong. But for  mobile apps the mbp would be better because of ios releasing etc, xcode. 


Should i try to hold on to see the new macs? Or just jump on one of these options now. If i pick between the razers i guess the 15 would be better because of the bigger battery and screen. But on the other hand ive never owned a  mac and that would nice too.


(The blade 15 is the base model)


Thank you for your help.",laptop
"Info:

MacBook Pro
Late 2011

MacOS Sierra 10.14.6

16 GB Unified Memory
512 GB SSD

Runs fine, I upgraded to a newer model. 
I’d obviously wipe it clean, has no physical deformities/wear. 

If more information is needed I can supply it. I just don’t know what I could resell it for and I don’t want overprice or underprice. 
The money will really help me out with tuition",laptop
" Should I buy the MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro? I like to play undemanding games, such as Terraria and Polytopia, sometimes I play Minecraft, but not a lot. I don’t need much RAM, 8 is fine enough for me, same with storage. I will be using it for stuff like excel, google classroom, Netflix, just general stuff that a high school student would use it for. If anyone has any points they can make to help me with my options, that would be great! :)",laptop
"I'm currently waiting on a MBP m1 in the mail as a friend got one and I am blown away to be honest. I'll give you a list of things that it does well and see if it matches up with what you want.

1. The battery life is insane, you can do normal work and get a day and a half to 2 days out of 1 charge. Even heavy work for a full day you're still left with a good chunk to get you through the rest of the day before needing a charger. 

2. Build Quality is great I'm sure you know Apple is one of the best for how it feels, looks and lasts. The screen being better than 1080p on the Razer is a bonus as well as better colors. I know you want to play games so the 60hz may not suit you but if the majority of your use is outside that it's far better. The laptop runs cool because the chip uses very little wattage, fans rarely if ever come on, even when it's doing a lot of work. Aside from that, keyboard is back to the magic keyboard, better than the last gen's flimsy keyboard. Touchbar is handy if it's of use to you, you won't really know the options you get with every app until you use it. Personally I hate using the trackpad every 2 seconds to go back a page, refresh or enter a new URL so its really easy to just tap.

3. Apple uses Rosetta 2 to translate windows x86 to m1 compatible and even if it can't read some windows apps or you can't download them, Parallel has a new M1 version so you can run a virtual windows desktop on it. 

4. Some cons would be the screen is a little small, I would have liked if Apple released the 14 inch this year with a few minor design changes like a 3:2 aspect ratio like the HP spectre. It's very close to the Macbook Air but the Air just lacks having no fans (not a problem with light work but with heavy work it is). I think they're bringing a mini-LED display to the next macbooks because this initial release was more than likely to get new users into the Macbook product line , test whether their claims of performance/battery was true and then next lineup will be the design refresh, new screen, m1x chip. They probably won't be able to improve battery life much more because they will have a more demanding screen, bigger chip to power unless they can keep improving it. 

Im gonna stick with the m1 until the new line comes, but i think it will be another Fall release, they won't release in March mid-covid since the m1 was backordered a lot and would be even worse with 2 new laptops",laptop
"Budget: 1,000 USD but cheaper is better obviously

Country: USA

Screen size: At least 13 inches

Screen resolution: At least 1080p, 1440p would be nicer.

Touch screen: Would be great but not strictly needed.

Weight: Lighter is better

Is battery life an issue? It would be nice but I'm not even sure what the expectations should be.

"Everything you say is a complete myth, and laptop batteries are made out of lithium ion or lithium polymer, and so are phones. Your knowledge is so far outdated. Nickel cadmium wasn't used in phones or laptops since the 1990s and older.

 Similar to a mechanical device that wears out faster with heavy use, the depth of discharge (DoD) determines the cycle count of the battery. The smaller the discharge (low DoD), the longer the battery will last. If at all possible, avoid full discharges and charge the battery more often between uses. Partial discharge on Li-ion is fine. There is no memory and the battery does not need periodic full discharge cycles to prolong life.

Hey all sorry to bug everyone again but Im really having trouble figuring out my purchase for pre order. It is a big purchase and I really only have one shot at it. I want a mechanical keyboard and a 3070 max P. 32GB of Ram and at least 1TB ssd (or smaller for less money but easy to add later). I get pretty worried about thermals as I am used to a desktop so above 70 makes me worry and sweat a bit lol. Here is what I seem to have narrowed it down to but I have no experience with any of them.

I like that ASUS uses liquid metal on their processor for better thermals. Ive heard MSI is easier to tweak in the bios for thermal controls but I have no experience with the AMD processor in the SCAR. Obviously I would rather have it sooner, but only if it is the correct machine. Again thank you so so much for all the help. Also Id like to keep it under 2500 dollars if you have additional recommendations. Thanks again!",laptop
"Depending on what exactly the problem was, it may be normal. If there was a software problem and the os needed to be reinstalled and the tech did a local reinstall(not online) then its common for it to be outdated.
Regardless, update and see if its fixed. If not, the repair guy may have installed malicious software or he may not have repaired the laptop propperly making some things worse than they were before, maybe on the thermal front. How much do you trust this repair shop? Also, what exactly needed to be fixed?",laptop

"Hello! I'd like to ask if the Intel Core i7-10750H is better than the Intel Core i7-1165G7!

The Dell has a few issues as well, and if you go to all the 1 star reviews or recent reviews, oh boy, some of those reviews do say that Dell is going to lose a lot of customers. The HP only has 1-2 bad reviews (as far as I know). I am going to high school next year, and I also want to game a bit! I don't care about the graphics card as I will get a GPU Enclosure for the HP-DY2028CA or Dell if it either is better than the Acer Aspire 7 (GPU doesn't matter).

"5600U, you mean. I wouldn't say it's worth losing a lot of money just to get the newer CPU. The thing is, Ryzen is being adopted more widely among OEMs so there might be better overall laptops (bright QHD 16:10 screens, better cooling solutions, sexier designs, Type C charging etc). Also, being based on Zen 3 gives the 5600U more cache and the tiny cache on the 4500U was a limiting factor in quite a lot of applications.






In short, if you're satisfied with your laptop, keep it because there's always something better around the corner. If you aren't, there are newer models coming with Ryzen APUs which will give you a better experience like the Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro or Asus ROG Flow x13.

Im a music artist, and a gamer (usually on console) but I'd like to know this PC's limits with programs like photoshop, cakewalk, audacity etc. 

I'd also like to be able to play minecraft java edition, and sims 4, cuz Ive invested quite a few dollars in it. (I had a laptop with 4gb ram and both played fine so I'm hoping this does too.) 

Also do you think it can handle COD Warzone? (Not a big deal either way)

I didn't have any questions till I saw a few rumors that minecraft couldn't run on it and stuff.. thank you!",laptop
"Hello everyone, I have a bit of an annoying thing - I know there's a sound switch in my dropdown menu that is supposed to be used for switching between audio modes (as in: silent, vibrate, normal). However, I don't want it to give me a sound/vibration feedback when I change the mode. I just want it to change it, I don't want to let everyone know I changed my phone setting. I am using OneUI 2.5 on my Galaxy A41.


I've set vibrations on 0, nada. I've disabled all the haptic feedback I've seen. It's this ONE particular thing that just won't change for some dumb reason.",samsung

I have the latest beta version of the Google Phone app running on my Samsung S21 Ultra.

I am trying to enable the verified calls option in the Caller ID & Spam options. The option is there and not fully greyed out, however, upon trying to activate it nothing happens. I have all permissions enabled for the phone app including locations and have my phone number registered to my Google account. Anyone who has got this feature working I would really appreciate some tips on how.

Thanks",samsung
"Because you probably used mobile data and don't sit at home all day, on wi-fi, with dark mode on, 60hz, everything turned off and battery saver on, just to post a screenshot on reddit. Your SoT is absolutely normal. That's what reviewers get when using the phone outside on mobile data with all features on that you paid for. Battery performance is mediocre at best on the s21 lineup and every serious reviewer concluded this. If you want great battery life, samsung is not the way to go.",samsung
"Yea, that's a nice Gecko and a nice pic. I've had Galaxy phones for the past 3 years but couldn't keep them. They were nice phones but I want a good camera so I stayed with the Pixels. I got the S21 Ultra and finally a keeper. The camera is great.",samsung
"Us Galaxy S21 owners may have a fix for the ever irritating fact that Android Auto is not wanting to work with our vehicles' head units for the Galaxy S21, 21+, and Ultras!

In the other big/recent AA thread u/NSAN8T (giving credit where due) posted that they tried using the short USB cable that came with their Galaxy Buds Pro's and their AA started working flawlessly.

Being as that I have had a few whiskey and colas, and willing to try anything to get my beloved AA working again (2020 GMC Sierra), I figured ""why the hell not?!""  Worst case is it still doesn't work but....

Holy Hell!  It works again and without issue!!!!  So if you have purchased the Galaxy Buds Pro's, I will second the notion of trying the short USB cable that comes with them.

I'd like to see what users experience in this thread in the hopes of reaching other S21 owners in search of a fix.  Cheers to the weekend y'all!",samsung
"I was disappointed at first as SD cards saved my life multiple times. As someone who doesn't back up as often especially during my busy days. I rather keep private and important stuff on my phone where it is easily accessible and the only way to access is through that only means. Having multiple backups increase the risk of getting hacked etc, and I wouldn't want to take the risk. and surely I don't trust the cloud storage, slow access, slow upload speed esp internet upload speed where I'm at.

 I also take a lot of photos so my 128GB sd card in my S7 and 256GB sd card in my A51 is full. Like I said earlier, I often need access to files however old it is. I remember back then I broke my Note 1 and I lost all my files from 2011-3. I broke my S10 last year's August and thus I bought A51 as a temporary phone. Luckily, most of my files were in sd card however files in a secure folder Unfortunately I'm unable to access secure folders even though I manage to move everything using a cable.  Repairing the phone here costs half the price of the phone and the risk of getting my data stolen (no matter how infinitesimal the chances) I surely don't want to take that risk.  


so I recently bought 512GB S21Ultra and I doubt I will be short in storage anytime soon, however, it would be great if Samsung at least retains the SD card in its ultra variant and I wouldn't mind paying more (it would be great if Samsung has options for s21U with sd card slot and without with different price range). I would definitely lose a lot of data if I ever broke this phone or if it got stolen. At least if I have important files in sd cards no matter how broken the phone would be I would still be able to get the data back. 50% data recovered is better than none at all.",samsung
"Color for the base S21 256GB in the US is actually gray not black - but I am guessing that's what you meant.  AFAIK, that is the only color option for 256GB on the base.  And be prepared to wait several weeks for it.  I ordered on Jan 17 and expected delivery is Feb 16.",samsung

"Having used both quite a bit over the last few years, I would say that Google's approach to Android over the past three iterations has been to gradual, I'm not even sure there is enough to really distinguish a yearly upgrade of late in terms of version numbers but that is another argument, and the OS as they publish it now is overly basic. Sure it is clean but I find OneUI to offer more features that I actually want to use and the interface is very snappy.

"No doubt. Learn about launchers and customizing. Download icon packs. Lawn Chair 2 is the best launcher I've used. Download GBoard for the best keyboard. Go through your settings and make it how you want it to be. Good Lock on the Galaxy Store adds great customization. Also enable dark mode on everything. And don't forget to go into software info - build number(hit five times to unlock dev settings), then set window animation scale, transition animation scale, and animator duration scale all to 0.5x. It will speed up animations and make the phone feel like it's running at lightspeed. DPI minimum width underneath those is also nice to change. Set to 400-465 depending on your liking.",samsung

There hasn't been anything I feel I'm missing from ""stock"" Android, as of yet.",samsung
"Phone is exynos S21, purchased it on 21st January, installed 2 updates in January.


After installing February update - had 30% battery drain last night - phone was in deepsleep as per accubattery.

This morning recharged to 100% and did 2 things- changed mobile network to 3g/2g and disabled mobile data.

Now after 14.5 hours of standby with about 30 minutes screen on time have 87% left.

Tomorrow will enable mobile data and continue testing.

This is not perfect workaround but if it will still keep normal battery drain with 3g mobile data enabled, will keep it like this till its fixed in firmware update.

Update:
Enabled mobile data this morning, still no crazy battery drain.
25 hours in, out of those 50minutes screen on time, 80% battery left -> really happy with the battery efficiency now.

Many apps still capture the screen on android instead of directly accessing the camera, something that's been available since android 2.0. It's awful tech practice.

This update just made my phone just worse. I had a s5 for five years before this and got my s10e in 2019. So I know annoying problems with Samsung. But These are just annoying. Before the update, on the lock screen I had a calculator and flashlight in one center bubble on the lock scree, I would hold the bubble and the two options would show and I just swipe my finger.

I have tried two different mounting stands and I am having this problem with both sets. Does anyone have suggestions on how I can make this work? Everything I'm seeing says I need an M8, and I'm wondering if anyone else has come across this issue? I can provide additional clarity if needed. Thank you!",samsung

In one other video the SD had a very low benchmark score, another one the Exynos had less overheating and another vice verse, some benchmark tests showed that the Exy had a 4000 Multi core points and some as low as 3000 etc..

I really can't understand what is going here, there is too much inconsistency that I can't judge whether the Exynos 2100 is bad as people are saying or it's just that they saw some comparison that had a different result, I think it's too early to judge whether Exynos is back or not, maybe the phones need to get more updated to get better stable results I guess we have to just wait, what are your thoughts?",samsung

9 years on and the only problem until last night was a worn charger plug (that would sometime act up, but was always fixable with a wooden toothpick clean-up).

Last night, the phone on the table from the day before, the screen had simply stopped working.

"Here's a tip for the buds pro:

 if you like ambient sound to turn on automatically with only putting one bud in then do not update the buds to the Feb patch. The new update removes this feature. The buds just stay in off position now with just one bud in. You the user either have to press and hold to turn it on or use the wear app now. 

There is also no way to toggle auto ambient sound with one bud in. Also they removed last known setting when both buds are put in. The buds just stay off. 

Here's how it used to work. I had anc on as the last known setting. When I go to put them in, one bud would turn on ambient sound as to not disorient me and once the second bud goes in anc automatically turns back on. This was a fantastic feature and very smart.

Now it just stays off. It doesn't remember jack shit. One bud in and noise setting is off. Put second bud in and noise setting is still set to off.

Why in the fuck did they do this? Why can't I choose to have how it was before this shitty update? Seriously this just made the buds a bit cumbersome. Why did they make them dumb? Who ever thought to do this should not have this level of say. This was stupid.",samsung

- I pay a premium and forfeit being able to take advantage of any carrier or Samsung launch promos

- Manufacturer warranty is only good in the country of origin. Eg. If I want to fix my device under warranty it has to be shipped back to Hong Kong for inspection.

- No 5G at all due to compatibility in Canada

Quick question, have you turned off scene optimizer? I have found it ruins pictures more often then it helps them but of course even with it off there is still too much processing. Pro mode helps a lot here as well as does using the high MP sensor when good lighting is available (64MP on the S21/S21+ or 108MP on the S21 Ultra) as they also have less post processing. I just wish Samsung could get out of their own way as they sensors are clearly capable of amazing things but they just don't do it consistently with all of their aggressive post processing.",samsung

"Howdy folks. I've had an iphone for over a decade now, first I got an iphone 3 in 2008 and I've only upgraded twice since. I now have an iphone 6S. Clearly, I don't upgrade very often. 

I'm also pretty used to iOS, even though I don't have any other apple devices (never liked any other part of their ""ecosystem"", always felt it was overpriced). 

So I guess my question is, for the folks more experienced with both Samsung and Android devices, do you recommend making the leap? 

A few points I'm considering:

-They say iOS has better optimized/utilized apps. I'm not sure how much of that is a myth since I haven't experienced them on Android. 

-Apple supports their phones for a LOT longer- I am running 14.3 on my 6s, and although it doesn't run that great and the battery is failing even after a replacement, that kind of longevity is pretty impressive. How bad does an Android run once it stops getting supported? Would an android phone from the 6s era still be limping along now?

-I genuinely like the hardware far better on the S21 Ultra than the 12 Pro Max. 120hz 4k is pretty juicy. For the software, there are features that I see that sound great on Android (splitscreen, picture in picture for everything, customization, etc.). But I do worry a bit about optimization. 

-Physical longevity. I treat my phones pretty nice, they rarely ever leave the case. I am a decently heavy user of my 6s and after all these years the sum total of damage it has received is two small little scratches on the screen- no chips, cracks, breaks, anything. I have dropped it though, and I'm wondering if the S21 would hold up as well to drops- I am hearing that it won't, which concerns me even though I'm careful. 

Anyways, thanks for any insight you folks can provide! I know it seems like I'm being overly precise with this, but as someone who very very rarely buys phones and even more rarely switches mobile OSs, it's a big decision for me. Thanks!",samsung

I've never had an issue with the Samsung cameras. I personally feel like the whole blur issue is overblown and haven't had any issues. That said, I don't think there's a big improvement vs the P2's camera (which is impressive for the P2 with how old it is) but the camera is also not a huge factor for me overall.

I do miss how well the P2 was integrated with Google (and especially the squeeze which is sadly gone) but a lot of those features have a similar counterpart with Samsung. There's also way more customization with Samsung's Good Lock suite.

Youtube music, spotify etc are made to play an playlist automatically. Youtube requires user interaction before a video can be played.

There is also no code written for Youtube for example to resume last played video. Spotify and YT music both can resume a playlist even if the app has been cleared from memory (RAM).

eBay has the Galaxy Fold for about $550-600, the Galaxy Fold for about $600-650, and the Z Flip 5g for about $650-700. I have no issue with used or refurbished, as long as the product is in good condition

On the one hand, I much prefer the larger design of the fold, but I am obviously concerned about durability, I know they fixed a lot with the Flip, and don't know how big the performance difference will be downgrading from a Snapdragon 865 to 855.

Does anyone have any advice? Is the Fold as fragile as it's made out to be? I heard the Flip is actually rather durable, is that true? Thanks in advance!",samsung

"I can't speak to the S20 but I had a P2XL since launch, got an S20 FE in October and just traded up to an S21. 

Hardware is amazing. I got a larger, 120hz screen in a smaller phone.  Battery is fine, it gets me through a day.  Screen is gorgeous.

Low light photos are comparable to my P2.  Outdoor photos are a noticable improvement.  Low light photos on the FE were horrendous. 

OneUI is.. fine. I spent the first month trying to make my Samsung as Pixel-like as possible before giving up and diving into that OneUI life and.. it's fine.  Honestly the only complaint is the sideways-scrolling app tray.. just three years of muscle memory down the tube.  Goodlock is pretty dope.

I'm not sure why bloatware would be a concern, it came with some junk preinstalled so I just.. uninstalled it.  FE had some junk I couldn't remove (eg: Netflix) but the S21 is fine.

What do I miss?  CALL SCREEN. I guess I miss Now Playing and GPay on the lockscreen.. but honestly, it's really just Call Screen.  Oh, and I miss the rear fingerprint reader but this one ain't bad.. far better than the one on the FE. 

At this point the only Google apps I still use over their Samsung alternative are Messages (can't get Samsung Messages to handle group RCS), Google Pay (Samsung Pay just seems.. overwhelming), and GBoard (Samsung's keyboard just isn't for me).

I'm not saying I don't miss the Pixel and how godawful simple the Pixel, but I wouldn't trade this S21 in for a P5.  I really do enjoy it. 

Just go into it knowing you won't enjoy it for the first few days while you acclimate and you'll be fine.",samsung

"Was in a similar situation,  bought the S21 ultra to replace my Pixel 2xl.

Pros:

The best part of S21 ultra was the screen, 120Hz is just amazing.

Everything felt buttery smooth and snappy, great build quality.

Outdoor camera pictures are really good.



Cons:

On the other hand, the camera is really awful when taking indoor photos.

Especially when taking pics of babies or pets, it smoothens the image a lot losing a lot of the details and for some reason, my baby's skin was showing up as orange or yellowish with orange spots.

The screen optimizer was mostly a miss, pics came out better with it turned off.

The pixel is a really great point and shoot, don't really have to mess with anything. But to get good pictures out of S21 had to fiddle with settings and have to tap to focus, which led to usually missing the moment. 


Didn't really like the One UI. 

Missing call screen functionality.

I really hope that the camera is fixed in future software updates, I really wanted to like this phone. Would have kept it if not for the camera issues.

Before this latest update if I put one bud in ambient sound turned on by itself which made it very comfortable to have only one in. And when I put in the second bud the last known noise setting would kick in, and for me that was anc. This made it a very smart device.

Now it's just cumbersome. And having the noise setting remain off with just one bud is causing a bit of disorientation which then makes it a bit uncomfortable.  And annoying that I have to tell it to turn on ambient sound by pressing and holding it. Why was the extra step needed?",samsung

However I fully support you, no paid for product should ever contain non-optional advertising. It's especially galling when Samsung has such good support for ad blockers baked into the phone, then ignores that philosophy to sneak their own in.

More and more I feel like Samsung are losing the plot and aren't making customer-focused decisions. Losing the 3.5mm jack was a big step and I'm very annoyed about it, but removing the charger after taking the piss out of Apple and adverts in the phone mean that my next phone is very unlikely to be a Samsung.

So, I have the S10+ right now and I'm thinking of upgrading.

So far I've had the S7, S8+ and now the S10+. I've had problems related to the port with every single one of them. The S7 simply went black when I plugged it in. The S8+ had the dreaded moisture detected problem TWICE.

Disabling battery optimization for that service dramatically improved fingerprint unlocking performance for me.

I decided to disable battery optimization for all of the other apps. Keep in mind I turn all animations off and in general I am very sensitive to lag. After the change, apps rarely reload and overall performance is faster than before.

A package disabler allows you to dsiable any package (app/service/whatever) that you want.  You don't need root.

Unfortunately Samsung hates the package disabler apps so they like to mess with the developers and make life as difficult as possible.  Because of that, atm there is only one package disabler you can buy called CCSWE app manager.

There used to be a free app called Alliance Shield X but recently Samsung dicked them over so their app doesn't work right now but they are trying to get it up and running.

People like me prefer a package disabler because you don't have to mess with adb as there is potential for boot loops and all that jazz.",samsung

Just a tip, whenever you send your device in again or do anything that involves using the phone, record it. Record conversations, take screenshots and upload it to twitter or any social media that will get your attention.

The only thing you may notice is that most users say apps on iPhones are generally better optimized especially the social media ones like snapchat and Instagram.

"Home/Default Launcher Constantly Being Reset


If you are experiencing issues with Nova not staying as the default launcher on Android 10 or Android 11, these first steps are for you specifically.


If you are having issues with Nova staying as your default launcher, try this: Reboot your device. Or you can try Phone Settings -> Apps -> Default Apps -> Home App -> Nova Launcher. You might need to do this several times and reboot several times for this to fix the issue. 


This is a very well known issue on Samsung and other devices, but specifically with new updates directly from Samsung starting as early as December 1st, 2020.


If this doesn't fix your issue, then you need to contact Samsung directly as the issue is on their end, with their update and has nothing to do with Nova or any other launcher, as this issue will happen in all 3rd party launchers.


The issue above isn't just for Samsung users, though the issue happens on every Samsung device that's gotten an update since December 1st, 2020.


Everything mentioned below is still present with the release of Android 11 on September 8th, 2020. Google has made it very clear that they have no plans to completely fix gesture-related issues any time in the near or even distant future. 


Please take note that Google admits to this being broken on their end of things and that a fix will be coming in a future update to Android (stated March 2019). 


However, it's now well over a year later and there are still many issues with full system gestures and 3rd party launchers on both Android 10 and Android 11. These issues will remain for the foreseeable future as Google have now made it clear that they have no plans to completely fix their full system gestures. 


Notable issues with gestures on third party launchers include:  

• Close all/Clear app button not appearing(scroll all the way to verify it's not there)  

• Not being able to tap icons for a short time after returning to the home screen  

• Animations not being as fluid as expected 


Please understand, there is absolutely NOTHING WE CAN DO TO FIX OR CHANGE THIS IN ANY WAY! Contact Google or your device OEM directly with these issues as we have absolutely no control over it whatsoever. 


Samsung Users 


Samsung has allowed full system gestures to be used within 3rd party launchers with their One UI 2.5 update. This means you can now enable and use gestures, but there are still several issues regarding animations and the like. 


As stated, there is nothing that Nova (or indeed any other 3rd party launcher) can do about this and it is ultimately up to Google and OEMs to fix navigation gestures. 


Google's statement and Nova's statement

"I just traded in my pixel 4 xl for the standard s21.

The photo camera is really good but still a slight level below the pixel camera imo. The pixel retains more detail and sharpness where the s21 wants to smooth things out. If you pixel peep, you'll notice. If you're just posting to social media, I doubt anyone will notice. It's still a decent photo camera.

The video camera is where the s21 takes over the pixel. The video is by far better, stabilization is better, colors are better, dynamic range, field of vision. All wins. 

Battery on the pixel 4 xl was decent but not great. Battery on the s21 is worse. It's still only a week old for me but so far the numbers are shaping out to be approx 13-14 hrs general usage, and 5 hrs screen on time. It should last you a day but you can't compare this to like a note.

"If you buy carrier branded Samsung phones in US then along with carrier apps, non carrier supported LTE/5G bands come disabled. So, if you want move away from your carrier then you will have to manually enable other carrier supported LTE/5G bands. Carrier branded phones get major updates first while unlocked ones get minor security updates first. Even though you have advantage of getting wifi calling, rcs messaging, video calling with carrier branded phones, same can be provided on unlocked phones by changing csc.
For carrier branded phones u also need to satisfy their unlocking policy to get it unlocked as even though u pay full price while buying from carrier or Samsung.com, they will come locked. Depending on carrier, you might face issues requesting unlock even though you have satisfied conditions for unlock depending on their customer service. 

How to enable LTE/5G bands and change csc instructions can be found in xda forums for your phone.",samsung

"I am torn about upgrading or keeping my trustworthy mint condition Galaxy S10+. It's a beautiful, powerful device coming up on its 2 year birthday. I recently held it next to the iPhone 12, and I was blown away with the superior build quality even now. The look and feel still holds up and in my opinion beats the Apple/S21 design.

I truly believe the S10 series was ahead of its time, and Samsung made a mistake pricing it so well with the features and components it had. The camera is stunning: night shots, panoramas, it does everything I need and more and 4K 60fps video and I'm not even a serious photographer. I don't need the better cameras of the S21 Ultra.

All of that being said, I still can't help but feel the urge to upgrade. The S10+ runs everything well and I've babied it, but it won't have support forever and I don't have 5G. I don't know how long 4G LTE will be around. One of the features I appreciate is the microSD slot, I only have a smaller microSD but it lets me expand up to half a TB.

There is a promotion at T-Mobile where I can basically get the S21 Ultra for $250 out of pocket after I trade-in my current phone and take their $800 promotional credit. There would be no monthly cost for the S21 Ultra itself after all is said and done. Still, I keep getting hung up on the microSD, the headphone jack, and the critiques of how the S21 series is disappointing. I use Bluetooth headphones but the jack is nice to have around.

I have to make a simple but difficult decision: Do I let my S10+ go and get the 256GB/512GB S21 Ultra, or do I hold onto it for another year and perhaps do a similar trade in deal for the S22 series? I don't know if there's any chance the microSD could come back, but if it did I would go for it 100%.",samsung
"Currently rocking the Oneplus 7 Pro and waiting to see how the Oneplus 9 turns out, however I'm kinda itching to join that Samsung life again. My concern however is how bad will the phones slow down after a couple of years of use.

Is this a case of like how apple slows down their old tech so you'll be more inclined to upgrade or was I just unfortunate with my tech getting slow. I loved how optimized everything was with Samsung and i'm interested in getting the S21 Ultra or Note 20 ultra.",samsung
"If you got money to spend then go for it.

Otherwise, no I wouldn't. The difference is minor and your S20 is not even a year old yet.

As for exchange, it really depends on the country you live in. For example, here in Australia it's 100% not worth it as they don't even give you quarter of what a new phone is worth. In America I've seen people getting as much as 700-1k or whatever on trade ins, which basically pays for the device itself.",samsung

I currently have an iPhone 7. I obviously do not have extreme requirements out of my phone. I’m not much for mobile gaming, and only have a handful of apps that I use regularly for messaging, social media, and other tasks.

I am not loyal to Apple or Android. I had a Droid Turbo before this iPhone. I do like that Apple as a corporation respects users’ privacy more than Google, but I have had a Gmail account for over 15 years anyway, and have sparingly used some other Google services. I do not like that the iPhone is relatively rigid in the way you work with it, cannot be customized to the same degree, and makes what should be really simple tasks unnecessarily difficult (eg transferring photos from your phone in an orderly, efficient manner without them being prisoner to an iTunes backup).

I am only looking for a phone as the battery in mine has degraded pretty far and it has to be charged numerous times per day. This is not as much of a problem now due to distancing, but the battery will only get worse, and one day battery life will be more of a concern again.

I have never used a Samsung device. I know some had issues with their skin years ago, but OneUI seems generally well received. I would imagine the Samsung would be a substantial upgrade over my current device. I do find the iPhone just a little small, as I have large hands,  and admire the screen to body ratio of new devices.

My iPhone is in mint condition, and I was surprised to see that Samsung will offer $250 for my device (assuming I don’t become another horror story with Samsung’s trade in program, I have read many where they claimed they received a different device or received it broken and the person did not receive the full trade in offer).

I am just looking for any and all opinions you all might have to help with my deliberations. Is this a good deal considering the trade in offer? Would you consider or wait for any other devices? Etc.

"So I've hesitated on getting a Samsung since I've always noticed something seemed off when I saw their photos. But when I smashed my iPhone 8 I figured why not, I was tired of Apple, and the specs of the S20 Ultra Plus camera are much better. So I assumed I would have nothing to worry about, makes sense right?

Well upon getting the phone, I've noticed quite a few things I'm heavily dissatisfied with - and after various googling it seems I'm not alone.

However, I still can't find any answers. All the information I'm finding is from the first release and I'm hoping there's some recent fixes since then.

Issues as follows:

By God, Instagram and Snapchat cameras. I've heard there's something to do with the app screen recording, instead of actually opening the camera like it does with an iPhone? Why isn't this fixable for the app developers? Do they have a secret 'deal' with Apple and optimization?

Taking photos in the camera app is all over the place. While some instances are great, others suffer. I've turned beauty mode off, but I *still* look smoothed. Red tones on my face for example are more pronounced, yet I still look pale. Some parts of the photo are overly saturated, while others are overly soft. *Please* don't tell me I will need to edit all of my photos after the fact.. 

Overall while the resolution of my old iPhone 8 is not anywhere close to that of the s20, I find things are so much more balanced on the iPhone and things like my skin look appropriately warm and not overly soft/red. Taking photos of my cat in motion are also a huge issue I'm noticing.

Anyone have the slightest bit of information or advice? Today has been my first day using it and while I seriously love all the features of this phone otherwise, the camera is a huge issue for me at this time.

Edit: ever* not every, sorry!",samsung
"I'm a Canadian Note 20u and watch 3 owner. I also have a Qled TV which received an update and now has ads. The ads in the stock apps are infuriating to me. I didn't allow anything for marketing and opted out of everything I possibly could and still have them. I will 100% not buy another samsung phone, TV or watch after this. 
Other than that I love the devices but it is an absolute deal breaker for me to get plastered with an ad that takes up 1/3 the screen in samsung health, weather and pay which provide core functionality to the flagship devices I purchased.

I've tried all the vpn adblockers, disconnect pro etc and none of them can block the ads in pay or health. A PI-hole removed the ads from the Qled tv.

Blocking *.sspapi-prd.samsungrs.com will remove the ad from weather. This doesn't show up in any default ad block lists currently.

I've scoured all the forums and can't find anyone with any success in blocking the ads in health or pay without killing the functionality of the apps. I've switched to google pay and and disabled samsung pay. Porting my health data to google fit is not that good of an alternative so I'm still stuck using samsung health.
It seems to be regional as there are people in certain countries not getting the ads and most people point at us agreeing to something to allow this or installing malware which certainly is not the case.

"Hi All,

Longtime redditor and Samsung user here.  So I wanted to let you all know about what I have going on here.  It is both good and bad.

So around 3 years ago, I found the perfect monitors to upgrade my 3 HP Zr-30w's with for Nvidia Surround.  The C32HG70!

I have loved every minute with them.  Well, for the first couple years, and even then, when they actually start working, the gaming was still great.  It just kept taking longer, and longer for the lines on the monitors to go away.  They started like the screen on the right, and progressed to the screen on the left.  The middle and right have looked like the left monitor.

So I found a thread and reached out to SamsungLou on Samsung Community.  Lou put me in touch with SamsungAL.  Great experience with both guys.  Al setup an out of warranty RMA, and after the new year, I sent them in.

Great I thought, I will get my monitors back with only the cost to package my monitors!  An inconvenience, but acceptable.

Well,  3 year old monitor.  No parts.  They did offer a pro-rated refund, so I may or may not get $547 out of the $1900 I spent on them back.  Depending on if I guessed which monitor was bought where correctly, according to the serial numbers.

Well.  Now I have no monitors.  Only a single HP ZR-30w left, the other two went to goodwill.

So some good customer service, but a really crappy ending.   I now  need to buy all new monitors and hope I get some money back.

  
Here is the real question I have to ask though.

How did these monitors have a 100% failure rate???  3 out of 3.  2 separate batches of monitors.  2 from Samsung and 1 from newegg.  All began failing in a little over 2 years.

Meanwhile, my HP ZR30W from 2010 is still working like the day I bought it?

Before the C32HG70, I have never had a monitor fail in my 35 years using computers.  From my first Tandy, which I overclocked from 50mhz to 66mhz using a jumper pin, until now.

3 out of 3.

Considering the QC issues I have been seeing on the Odyssey line, I thought people might want to have some food for thought on some longer term use.

"After having received my S21 Ultra (exynos) I was excited to see the company Zoom Audio has recently released a usb c plug in mic, [ the Am7 ](https://zoomcorp.com/en/de/mobile-audio-recorders/ios-microphones/am7/) (specifically for Android).

After installing the ""handy audio app"" (by Zoom Audio) and plugging in the Am7 (and allowing all permissions) the audio levels go to Max (static like) regardless of the physical gain setting on the mic, even in a quiet environment.

I also tried using the stock camera app, and even 3rd party camera apps but the result is the same : doesn't record sound, even though the led mic levels indicate it's picking up sound.

I reached out to Zoom Audio and they got their hands on a snapdragon s21 ultra and they claim it works perfectly.

Are there any hidden or developer settings that are interfering with the external mic?

"All social media apps are optimized for iPhones simply because there are only a few models made every year, which also happen to use the absolute same software version, skin and so on. Android phones are released left and right, each with its own version of Android, most of them aren't even on the same version. That's why it's extremely hard to optimize the apps, so what they came up with is for the phone to take a screen recording of what you are shooting, rather than use the actual camera. It's not a deal with Apple, devs can't optimize it for every single phone out there.

As for skin smoothing-yes it is an issue. They say that you can fully disable it with the s21 series. Not sure if it will come as a future update but as of now it is a real issue and unless you take the perfect photo - you'll have to edit it.

Personally, after all I've read and tested, I've come to the conclusion that the way you charge your phone nowadays has little to no effect on your battery life. It may have in the long, long run but usually it doesn't. 

I've personally always known how much battery I would use on a given day if nothing unexpected occurs. So if I know that I'll use roughly 50% tomorrow, I'll charge my phone only if it's below 60% when I go to bed.

However, with my note 10, I charged it pretty much every single night for more than a year, and it did not impact my battery in any noticeable way.

But on the flipside, his fitness and defence were strong and he showed more staying power at 2-sets-to-1 down than I expected.

"Training is one thing. Competitive match play is another. He hasn’t had much, or any for that matter, of the latter this past year. There’s no way you can practice and simulate the pressure of a match. You just have to play them. That’s what sets players apart—how they navigate that high stakes environment. You can only hone and fine tune this in real matches over time. 

Not only is it a way to get points and earn money, it’s absolutely invaluable. It’s why lower ranked players, who at certain times are spending more money travelling to the places they’re playing at than the money they’re earning, keep at it. It’s practice in a way, but, a very specific kind of practice you can’t get anywhere else. It’s cut throat and you just have to keep at it to make it in this sport. It’s almost a tautology—you have to play to play.

Good enough to make the top 20 yes, and I think at his peak perhaps a top 10 player on grass.

But with his junior career, expectations and talk of winning 10 slams it would have cut deeply to have the realisation I assume at some point that he was never going to be one of the real elite.

I watched a 2016 or 2017 match when he was around his peak ranking against Djokovic on hard courts in Tokyo.

Bernie went down a break in the first set but snatched it back. He was fruatrating Djokovic with pushing the ball around and he struggled to get a consistent read on the pace of shot. Really wonderful court craft and reading of points. 

Thing was was Djokovic was fitter and looked a better player. It was a long tie break and Bernie looked like his head would explode at the end of it. Djokovic won it, maybe 11-9 or some such. 

No surprises second set was a damp squib, 6-2 to Djoker or thereabouts.

"I just read the article in SI - made (yep, not written) by someone called CHRIS ALMEIDA.

Here's the link:

[https://www.si.com/tennis/2021/02/10/novak-djokovic-the-heels-have-eyes-daily-cover](https://www.si.com/tennis/2021/02/10/novak-djokovic-the-heels-have-eyes-daily-cover)

And I'm feeling pretty giddy about it. Not because it's a good article - because it isn't. Not because it's written well - because it isn't. But because it's just another sign of the fact that certain processes that have gotten momentum in the past 10-20 years are continuing and moving forward unobstructed, and will ultimately lead to deserved outcomes. Well deserved outcomes.

The article is full of contraptions, constructions, spins, half-truths, outright lies and such - but most impressive is the TONE of the article. It's a hateful, passive-aggressive, mean, ugly word-salad that outs its author as a small-minded, half-literate, lesser human being - full of hate, envy, racism.

Chris Almeida (that's the name of the person that wrote this article) uses everything and anything to, under the breath, paint a terrible picture about Novak Djokovic.

Something like:

*"" In the video, Djokovic claimed that toxic food and polluted water could be cleansed “through the power of gratitude.” ...""*

Which, of course is a lie.

Then he continues with quoting Nick Kyrgios, of all people, as that would give any credibility to his POS article:

*""Boneheaded decision to go ahead with the ‘exhibition’ speedy recovery fellas, but that’s what happens when you disregard all protocols. This IS NOT A JOKE.” (Nick's fake outrage about the ""adria tour"").*

Then, he of course, has to make a point that Djokovic had a preferential treatment in AUS:

*""Controversially, Djokovic (along with Nadal, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka) was flown to Adelaide to complete his quarantine in more accommodating quarters.""*

Followed by a note that Novak ""didn't include women"" in his PTPA, and a smaller note that Sir Andy Murray had righteous objection to that (while himself doing nothing for anyone, ever, rather than for himself)

And so on...

Then it comes the ""mandatory"" preaching about ""responsibility of his platform"" (Novak's), and a lot of masterbathing of that sort, on and on, ad noseaum and ad infinitum.

&#x200B;

And finally finishing with:

*""And now, amid a pandemic, who knows how much harm has been done because the most famous man in the Balkans, and the most important man in tennis, has endorsed the flouting of COVID-19 guidelines and the avoidance of vaccines. ""*

Missing only one little point - even after the adria tour, and even today - Serbia has the LOWEST mortality rate, among the lowest in the world (proportionally) rate of infection, and the final fact - that Serbia, TODAY is COMPLETELY OPEN (restaurants, public venues, events, schools... etc etc - all WORK AND ARE OPEN - with some minor restrictions - e.g. restaurants close at 10PM and such).

So, it's fine. We're of the opinion that this f",tennis

He has only not made the quarter finals once since 2005. This is a better record than the French Open.",tennis

I am 19 years old and I have been playing tennis since I was 8 with some breaks in between. Nadal was the player that got made me love the sport and that basically explains where the qquestion is coming from. I d love to have a similar forehand to his. So my question is why does everyone say that its difficult and that requires big muscle mass etc? And are there any pro ATP players that have a close enough forehand to Rafa's?,tennis
"Do you think players would rather have him on their own side of the draw or on the other side of the draw?

I don’t think anyone is interested defending his off court behavior or his interactions with the media.  I also don’t think any players want him on their own side of the draw because he sometimes has those days where he shows up and just ass blasts you off the court and it could happen at any time",tennis

"I think that 2008 to around 2015 ish give or take was really just the pinnacle of tennis. The big four all peaked somewhere around here, and though the big three have still been winning since, they certainly aren’t what they were. I really don’t see 2011 Djokovic losing to himself present day in a best of 5, and I’d say the same about Federer and Nadal. They’re all still fantastic and Djokovic is probably not far from his peak but they’re declining. The age difference between Djokovic and Thiem is very close to the age difference between Federer and Djokovic, but Thiem is now about 6 years late to break through and surpass the king of his era. The reality is the big three are the best three players that have ever overlapped careers and because of the longevity of all three, especially Federer, there is never going to be a way to settle the argument about eras between Federer and Djokovic. People thought Federer was near retirement in 2011. It skews the perception of players as they play toward their twilights, especially when they still are pretty damn good at the age they are. If you watched 2019 Wimbledon you couldn’t say Federer wasn’t up for the task as a player, but the dude was 38. Same in 14-15. He spent a lot of time losing the Djokovic, but he could’ve been retired at that age. If you take Federer out of 14-15 the era weakens but why is a 35 year old strengthening an era in the first place?  It’ll be interesting to see what happens if Djokovic plays close to age 40 and competes at a top 10 level, which I don’t think is out of the question. I think the real answer to the weak era strong era is Nadal got absolutely fucked, and has easily had the hardest era of any player alive. Still has 20 slams and is likely going to break that record in a few months.",tennis
"Medvedev does somewhat rightly get called robotic and even (wrongly) a pusher, but he is so goddamn crafty it is insane.

"I might be in the minority, but I love that there are no Lines Judges in AO.

I know some part-time employees are now job-less, but during Covid-19, this makes sense.

However, I hope it continues. I think it is good for the sport and good for the players because: 

* Calls are quickly and correctly--at least as much as possible--rendered almost instantaneously, allowing play to continue.
* It's visually cleaner and easier to focus on the match.
* Players must keep the focus on THEIR game, not on whether a call was in or out.
* There are just WAY too many lines people on court: judges outnumber players three or four to one (almost every other sport is the opposite).

"Probably unpopular but hard disagree. The shot clock is fine. 25 seconds from the time the umpire calls the score to serving is also fine, even if you have to get your own towel. Its also fine after extended points too. That's part of the beauty of the sport, putting a massive effort in and then having to recover and possibly do it again quickly.

Feli continued to play well for the entire match.

But then Fed just ascends to a level of shotmaking that is unreal and destroys Feli in a manner that would make the younglings feel like they got off easy.",tennis

I met Nick 5 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but Nick fucking Kyrgios himself. I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there with his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I’m trying to quiet her down because I didn’t want her to bother Kyrgios, but she wouldn’t stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Kyrgios put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the barbershop. Chill guy, really nice about it. Would let him breast feed my niece again.",tennis
"Mackie desperately needed this, after this tournament he only had 2 tournaments left to use his protected ranking before it expired.

If he wins against Harris (he’s probably slight favorite) he goes back to 130ish in the world, so there will still be some pressure for him to do well in the other 2 tournaments he enters with that protected ranking, in order to get back up to around 75 where he can enter full ATP tournaments.

It could be 25 seconds but with each player having an extra 25 seconds grace time that start getting eaten into if they let the time reach zero, warnings only starting once they have eaten all that time (it would still not be possible to have 35 seconds per serve every serve like Rafael Nadal under the old rules).",tennis

Evans just kept making him play one more shot, took his chances (even the half chances, that forehand pass in the First set on break point was beautiful) and went out there to win the match. FAA, you could see the pressure he was putting on himself to win the title, not the match. There is a difference. If he‘d played the player and not the occasion, then who knows.

Right now, that lack of title is living rent free in head.

For Dan, I hope he builds on this and goes on to bigger things. I’m hoping with a kind draw he can set a career best grand slam result at the AO.",tennis

This is my first glimpse of anything to do with the draw so it’s interesting that Rublev is in here but the person who made the pic hasn’t got him advancing to face Rafa. At a glance Rafa has the toughest draw by far considering his lack of matches going in and the youth/ form of the players in his draw.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Roger Federer.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into tennis in the last couple years. So you never watched FedEx in his prime.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: tennis isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""ELO rating"" or ""% win by GS"" I know they know nothing about tennis.

Roger's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest serve and volleyer ever, and started as a ball boy in Basel.

So when I hear somebody say that Novak Djokovic is better than Roger Federer, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Federer in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched tennis for a significant amount of time, so I know that Federer is better.

You might be jealous of Federer's 9 Wimbledons, or jealous of his status as the greatest winner of the Stefan Edberg Sportmanship Award, or whatever. Unless you're a Lendl fan who watched tennis in the 80s, or a Sampras fan who watched tennis in the 90s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win tennis looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Federer isn't even a top 100 player ever.

So if you want to accept it's reasonable to define talent that way, it shouldn't be difficult to understand where people are coming from. The world is full of incredibly talented people in all kinds of fields who never achieved jack shit, because success depends on so much more than talent. In which case, your argument that Nick's lack of achievement proves a lack a talent simply doesn't work.

"I know it would be overreach, but I wish we could ban all Kyrgios talk and just make a separate sub for all things Kyrgios and all his stans and haters could go there.

Tennis wise, Nick Kyrgios is irrelevant. Didn't even qualify for ATP Cup. Sure, he's got the talent, but he's squandered five years of his career that he can't get back. If he suddenly cared, he won't be starting from square one. With the way he's neglected his body, he'd be starting at a negative. If by some miracle, he put everything he had into winning a slam, he might win a Wimbledon or AO, but he won't. Not if it's not more than a maybe. 

The current generation of talent(Thiem, Medvedev, Tsitsipas, Sinner and others) are good enough that someone can't sneak in a weak era slam. 

What Anna Kornakova was to modeling and tennis is what Nick Kygrios is to social media and tennis. Not the perfect comparison considering Kyrgios has six to Kornakova's 2(ITF), but looking at the entire resume it's fair. Kornakova has one slam semifinal appearance to Kyrgios' zero(and there is no sign he'll get one. Kornakova has been ranked in the top ten. Kyrgios has a career high of 13. Kornokova also has a very successful doubles career she can hang her hat on. 

To the casual fan they are relevant more for what they do off the court than on it. To the dedicated fan of tennis, they'll always be lost potential. The only difference for the more dedicated tennis enthusiast is that Kornokova's lack of success was mocked. With Kyrgios, it's just sad.

**Barty Kovinic :** Rust is apparently not a thing for Ashleigh Barty. The loveable nugget from Australia took an entire year off from the tour due to Covid concerns, but started off this year as she does most years, by making the finals of the inaugural event. She has looked just as good as she ever was this week, and in the spot where she was likely to stagger against Bouskova (who was playing some excellent tennis in the 2nd and 3rd set) she was able to steady herself despite visible frustration. Although she has a finals left against a peak-form Muguruza, Barty’s fitness has never come into question, and since the WTA plays the 2/3 format, she shouldn’t really struggle with fatigue in the early rounds. 

Kovinic has been a really consistent performer in early rounds on tour the past season or so, and she represents a very consistent baseliner who generally beats the players she’s supposed to. Barty just doesn’t give up the easy errors though, and will be sharp following some good matches this week. In Barty’s past as well as Osaka’s and Serena’s is losing sets in early rounds of majors, but here I think she will have ample time to right the ship even if she does go down an early break. Barty in 2.

**Gavrilova Sorribes Tormo :** This is a tough match for both players. Gavrilova struggled with injury for a while, but despite the lopsided scores against Serena this past week she played well. There are a lot of quality baseliners on the tour so the fact that these two stand out as very consistent",tennis

He played a great first set against Raonic today then instantly gave up when he was struggling in the 2nd. And he doesn't even hide it, he'll be kicking balls/parasols, throwing his racket etc. How do you even become a pro athlete with this mindset? I remember the same thing happening last RG against FAA when he literally stopped trying after a set.

This kind of play is not conducive to a very successful tennis career. Being able to beat Nadal/Federer/Djokovic doesn't matter that much to your ranking or prize money if you aren't 90% to beat unseeded players.

I reckon he had enough for a highlight reel before he even won a game yesterday! I think that's part of his problem, he's playing as if he's facing Djokovic every round, needing ridiculous speed and placement to gain advantage in a point, but against qualifiers and other weaker opponents he's just risking giving them free points.

"I cannot shake the thought that Nick Kyrgios is the saddest story in Australian sport.

Celebrities get asked a corny old question all the time. What would you tell your teenage self? As Kyrgios sulks in his hotel at the start of a new lockdown tomorrow, looking out enviously at the Melbourne sun and prepares to participate in the rest of the AO as just another Instagram troll, a penny for the opposite interaction between young and older.

What would the starry-eyed 19-year-old Kyrgios say to the world-weary 25-year-old version? Probably something along the lines of, bloody hell, old mate, why'd you start missing the tweeners?

Oscar Wilde once said that he was so clever even he didn't understand what he was saying sometimes. One could say the same thing of Nick and his on court strategy.

The 19-year-old was the best teen in the world by a million miles. So good he was signed by IMG in 2015, alongside Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova, as a sure-fire future major champion. He said in an interview after a big win that, ""I am so happy I don’t really know what I’m saying right now.” Now? What a sad quote that has become.

He was playing Dominic Thiem for the first time in Melbourne. Kyrgios's trophy cabinet and the Austrian's trophy cabinet? The uninformed observer would think you couldn't tell their collections apart on the evidence of this contest, a clash of the titans that reverberated throughout the city. As an athlete, Kyrgios ain’t exactly matured like a Mount Mary cabernet, but he's still got that X-factor in spades(and could probably go some of that cabernet after the match).

He could have been anything, this fella. He reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals as an 19-year-old in 2014. He was the most explosive debutante quarter-finalist since Boris Becker in 1986. He had Nadal covered for the quality of tennis in the fourth round.

Inexperience didn't seem to matter. At one set all on Centre Court, with Australian fans in full support — “Let’s go, mate, let’s go!” — and Nadal anxiously pushing his hair behind his ears in uncertainty, fidgeting furiously with his bottles, shaking his head, rubbing his brow, Kyrgios was all over him. When Kyrgios won in four tough sets, he said: “I think I was in a bit of a zone out there. You’ve got to believe you can win the match from the start.""

Llegs Hewitt backed him to go deep on the eve of this 2021 tournament. Kyrgios reportedly threw himself into a veritable Rocky montage of training in preparation for the event where he planned to finally make good on all his promise. He wanted to consign his history of false starts and shameful distractions to the past.

And what a sideshow he's put on over the years. The alleged cheating on Oz's sweetheart Ana Tomljanovic, the unspeakable roasting of Pablo Carreno Busta on IG, the annual tanking in China and the plummet in the rankings to #47 in the world. He used to be as high #13. A bad omen, it would seem.

Sad, all of it. I’m not buying his brav",tennis

That's why I learned to plan my return before the serve is ever hit.

"That was a match worthy of being a 4th round or more, and I'm disappointed it wasn't. However, I can't change rankings, so I'll just have to talk about it now.

Let's talk about Sinner first. Obviously, he's dealing with a lot of fatigue and exhaustion right now, but he really wasn't letting it get to him. Though he looked it, he kept running and fighting for the entire match, and thats great to see from a young player. He easily could have withdrawn, or given low effort. But he fought for this, despite the reality that there probably wasn't much he could do in the end. Shapovalov is just a little too good right now, and he was too exhausted to really have a chance to pull through. The fact that he made it as close as it was is a testament to mental strength and commitment to the game.

On to Shapovalov. His performance wasn't as good as the USO-Rome stretch last year, but it was certainly quality. He was finding his serves when he needed them, the netplay was working, and he executed the slider-forehand combo effectively. There was a little bit of a dip in level after the break in the fourth, where he stopped playing quite as well and gave Sinner the chance to get back in it, but overall he did a great job of maintaining his game.

What really decided this match, (aside from Sinner's fatigue), was the sliding serve wide from the ad-side by Shapovalov. Sinner just didn't have an effective strategy for neutralizing the point on these, and it cost him numerous chances. Especially in the sets Shapovalov won, he was executing the combo off this serve near perfectly, and it locked Sinner out of his service games. As much as I want to say Sinner could've taken this with full rest, Shapovalov was just executing that combo too well when his level was up. It certainly would've been closer, but I just don't think Sinner would've been able to push through it enough times. 

Thats just my thoughts on a wonderful match. I'm excited for both of them in the future, and they both have clear things to work on. Sinner needs to develop a slice so he can neutralize backhand returns better, and Shapovalov needs to still clean up his second serve a bit.",tennis

"I’ve been playing for almost 20 years, played competitively at some point and now do some coaching. 

Rafa’s forehand is pretty much 2 major things added together. 

1: like you said, the whipping motion makes his balls extremely heavy. This makes it difficult not just because the balls are heavy and require a ton of energy to hit back, but because they easily create angled shots that make you move around a lot. I’m a tall guy, around 6’3, and when I was playing competitively, players with forehands like this were always grueling. Where my height would allow me to hit most balls in my sweet spot, around arm level, players like Nadal would push me back behind the baseline, or require me to catch everything on the bounce up. 

On the power generated side, When you have a flat power hitter, it’s easy to play against them because you use their own power and momentum to return their balls. A flat power shot doesn’t require much more beyond a flat shot. The original power is just returned. That’s why flat serves can be returned at a similar speed if you kind of just put your racket out and hit the ball at the right angle. 

But with a high spin ball, you have to **really** dig and get under the ball, do a big swing, and hit the ball back with a lot of spin. Otherwise, the spin will throw off your hit. **So whereas flat hitters often just use the same original power transferred back and forth, someone like Rafa requires each shot to generate a whole lot of power.**. This makes it extremely tiring. I would much prefer 5 sets against a power hitter than 3 against a Rafa style of player. 

2: he’s a lefty. Lefty’s just have that natural spin, so add this to point 1, and you have a ridiculous forehand. His extreme grip is also one you rarely see in young players, so people struggle to play against this style because it isn’t common. 

On top of these two, the guy is crazy athletic, so he will absolutely wear down opponents. 

Finally, one of the things that make his forehand tricky is how consistent it is. I always tell students, **look at the clearance level of each of his balls**. In other words, look how high above the net each ball is. It’s incredible. Whereas a lot of us amateurs barely clear it or clip it often, his don’t struggle with that because they’re so loopy and they drop down. This high clearance level also makes it easier to do extreme shots that kick outwards, making opponents run more. 

Add to this that this isn’t the norm when it comes to style play, so people like Rafa have the natural oddity and rarity that makes them even more difficult to play. 

TLDR: instead of transferring the power between flat shots and flat shots, high topspin requires players to generate each stroke. It’s extremely tiring. 

Hope this helps",tennis

"There are so many flash in the pan stories in tennis where you have an uncelebrated player making it through the draw to the championship match, occasionally stealing a famous win but usually losing to the more established player. But from when the ATP tour started in 1972, you find that it is extremely rare for a player to lose a final against a slam champion or all-time great and not get another chance against a player of lower calibre. For example, Federer has *never* beaten someone with 0 career titles in a final who didn’t get a chance at a trophy elsewhere against an opponent who’d never been in a masters or slam final. The statistical likelihood of never winning a title and only playing a current or future slam winner in all career finals is very low. 

Here’s my top 10 unluckiest players to make it into that statistical minority. 

&#x200B;

**10: Jan Apell (Sweden)** 

**Opponent: Thomas Muster in Stuttgart 1995** 

In 1995, Muster was the Nadal of his day. He ploughed through the claycourt opposition like Bruce Lee at an under-10s karate tournament. His clay title haul of 12 in 1995 is 4 more claycourt titles than Nadal has ever won in a single season(8 in 2005 is the closest he got). So to play Muster on the dirt in ’95 was to be a lamb to the slaughter, yet Apell retained his dignity in a 6-2 6-2 loss. Apell also managed a run to the semi-finals at Queens in 1994, beating Ivanisevic and narrowly losing to Sampras in three sets. Only scoring 44 wins in singles, his titles came in doubles where he won 10 and also finished runner up at the French.   

&#x200B;

**9: Mike Cahill (USA)** 

**Opponent: Jimmy Conors in Stowe 1979**

Connors was the world no. 2 in 1979 and at the peak of his trophy-trawling singles career, taking 8 events and getting to the final of 4 others. Cahill could only take one game against that force of  nature, losing 6-0 6-1. But he’d do better in their fourth round match at the USO in 1981, where Connors won 6-3 6-3 6-1. Cahill was 0-22 against top 10 players. 

&#x200B;

**8: Harel Levy (Israel)**

**Opponents: Marat Safin at Toronto Masters 1000 in 2000, Thomas Johansson at Nottingham 250 in 2001**

Levy went 63-99 in his career and got as high as 30 in the rankings. Safin was the toughest draw you could get in the North American hard court summer swing in 2000, during which he beat Sampras twice and took home the USO title. Johansson was considerably less formidable, but he was on a 9-match grasscourt streak at the time and after beating Levy sealed the Halle/Nottingham double, making him an outside pick for the Wimbledon title. The Swede won the Australian Open at the turn of the following season, and in retrospect his form on grass was a sign of things to come. Across both of his runs, Levy beat Roddick, Sebastien Grosjean, Wayne Ferreira, and Jiri Novak, all of whom had long stays in the top 10. 

  

**7: Todd Witsken (USA)** 

**Opponent: Andre Agassi in San Francisco in 1990**

Witsken was Agassi’s first ",tennis

"Well that was an intense day of tennis!

Italy vs Spain

- Fognini/PCB: Fognini in 3. I honestly can't explain it, but Fognini turned it on for this match. He went for his shots, made them, and in the end there wasn't much PCB could do. Hopefully he can maintain this form.

- Berrettini/RBA: Berrettini in 2. I'm sorry for doubting you Matteo, you played brilliantly. Powerful forehand and serves, brilliant netplay, and renewed confidence. RBA played well, but full strength Berrettini is a force of nature.

(No doubles, being a walkover for Italy.)

Russia vs Germany

- Rublev/Struff: Rublev in 3. Despite a shaky start, Rublev found his form and is just a better player than Struff. Once Struff started missing some first serves, it was all BWEH.

- Medvedev/Zverev: Medvedev in 3. For a third match in a row, Medvedev played not great, but came through. Zverev started insanely well, then dropped off from a back tweak in the second, got back into form in the third, and then hit the worst second serve ever to hand Medvedev the break. Medvedev then spent 5 mins giving me a stress aneurysm by cycling between choking and being insanely clutch. Eventually, through the power of Zverev's mental issues, this match came to an end. 

(The doubles are currently going on for this tie, but its reserves and won't affect anything, so I'm going to pass on waiting.)

Overall Thoughts: Russia should be the better team, but I've already made so many mistakes disregarding Italy that I refuse to say it again. Italy tomorrow in 2 singles ties, by virtue of some higher power that is laughing at me currently.",tennis
"Federer - He never liked Novak, even when Novak was nowhere near Roger and Rafa. He was a poor loser couple of times. He's a hypocrite who is not looking to help lower ranked players.

"Also, blame Sinner's coach for not winning, not the scheduling. He had a very clear path to victory in this match, whether he was tired or not, because IMO, and I think is kind of being accepted throughout the tennis community, Sinner is already a better player than Shapo is.

Shapo is without a doubt the shakiest second server in the top 50 (Zverev included). If you stand as far back as Sinner does, you relieve so much of the pressure Shapo usually puts on himself during his second serve. Why on earth would anyone willingly do this against Shapo?",tennis

I understand that Australians went through hard lockdowns to get case numbers of Covid down. However, just because the head of government agreed to let the Aus Open happen that doesnt mean you can run a tournament with unfair playing conditions and then shut down complaints with ""Australians are struggling to get home."" Tennis players are there to compete and the government was willing to let them in the country to maintain flow of $$$$$$. 

I read this quote from the CEO of Tennis Australia:

 ""I get the feeling it is perceived as preferential treatment,"" Tiley said. ""But they're the top players in the world. My general rule is if you're at the top of the game, a Grand Slam champion, it's just the nature of the business.

"If I didn't know any better, looking at the woman's draw, you'd think it was specifically made for Barty to have a relatively easier draw compared with the others.

Most of the in form players that have also done great historically in AO, happen to be in the bottom half. And all the out of form players (Bencic, Martic, Pliskova, Kenin) that have lost deplorably recently, happen to be in the top half.  The only apparent threat is Alexandrova.

"the shot clock was one of those things the commentator class (e.g. brad gilbert) said would be a great idea and speed up the game. it didn't. they talk about it far too much on the broadcasts, and its only measurable impact has been negative, like what happened to Tiafoe yesterday.",tennis
"As a Tiafoe fan, my night has been fucking made. I don't care if he loses from here, which is most likely, what I care about is that he has showed fight and has played some great tennis. He took a fucking set! I'm beyond ecstatic, lets go Big Foe!",tennis
"OP here. Let me just clarify this as the shot clock is this weird thing that tends to provoke a pretty polarised response:

1: By most accounts the shot clock has not achieved its intention, in fact it seems to have had the opposite of the intended effect: http://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/2019/01/31/another-slam-another-pointless-serve-clock/

And Murray and Monfils (along with Simon, Djokovic, Nadal etc) think it's useless in its current version: https://twitter.com/enricomariariva/status/1328793347956334592?s=20

2: The way it's currently enforced feels broken to me. The men's game is overwhelmingly played in the 0-4 shot range, and the long points, or points over 9 shots, are in the extreme minority. For example in today's Djokovic Tiafoe match just 14% of the total points went over 9 shots, and this is actually higher than the avg for many hard court events, for eg the Kyrgios Humbert match only featured 7% of the total points as 9+ rallies. Therefore it feels strange to disincentivize an entertaining minority of long points in situations like today, where the players were gasping for air after a few gruelling strings of points and also during the hottest part of the day, during the hottest day of the tournament so far. Tiafoe is super, super fit, and literally anyone would be struggling physically after playing those kinds of points against the world No.1 in the middle of the Australian summer (also both Nadal and Djokovic who are two of the fittest players ever have also been hit with plenty of time violations and occasional loss of 1st serves). In those situations there are two choices: 1. enforce the shot clock and either strip the player of a second serve or rush them into an error (neither of which are good for the overall show) or 2: just accept that some small minority of periods of play are harder than others and give the players some leeway. It's not like Tiafoe was messing around at the back of the court when he got the warning or holding up play to an egregious degree, he was on the verge of starting his service motion as the clock reached 0. And you can also see Novak trying to catch his breath at the same time, so any notion of one player gaining an unfair advantage in this particular situation seems unlikely (which should be the only real reason the rule exists).

This happened just a few months ago as well at the ATP Finals. Rublev and Tsitsipas played an epic 25 shot point & Rublev won it to set up a match point. But while trying to catch his breath he ended up rushing his serve for fear of the clock & double faulted & went on to lose the match. That is a shit situation to encourage. Rublev interview here: https://twitter.com/NikolausFink/status/1328830470231126016?s=20

I never said 'the shot clock is bad' as the title says, but the current application of the rule, in situations as above, isn't good for tennis in my opinion. It's expecting an unreasonable level of recovery after tough points from players that are already e",tennis
"There's a lot of great matchups, but don't forget about Alcaraz-Van de Zandschulp. Alcaraz is a more talked-about prospect, but even if you take away Van de Zandschulp's results this past week, he's still been very impressive recently. Plays a hard-hitting, aggressive style of tennis.

That match should be a very good one.",tennis
"It's a pretty inexact science to rank something like this unless you boil it down to overall career record of the winner versus the runner up. But I tried to take into account the respective form and record of the players at the time and the court surface, along with estimating what the highest level of the runner up was in otherwise inconsistent careers.",tennis
"People talking about how bad Felix is in finals are forgetting that he's just been kinda bad in general in the last 12 months. 6-12 vs. top 50 players and 1-6 vs the top 20 - had a bunch of really easy draws to get to the finals, just like this one.",tennis

"Don't share your opinion, I'm in Frew's corner on this one.

Also appreciate Frew's less is more approach, you don't have to talk the entire match like Petchey or J-Mac.

Don't get me wrong, I like Petchey, Lester and Koenig, but let's not pretend like they're not flawed... Actually, hard to pick flaws in Lester but you get my point.

Guy that I really miss is Jason Goodall, he's the gold standard for me but seems like he only works for ESPN these days.

"""Let"" is an absurd rule anyway.

I get the logic. The point hasn't started yet, so unlike a let-cord during a point, it's reasonable to not play it out as let-cords are deemed unfair.

But I still think it's insanely stupid. Holds up play, questionable let calls, and lets on serves are basically never dead let-cord winners, they just slightly alter the serve, if at all.

Plenty of organized tennis, including NCAA tennis, is played with lets on serves, and several tennis commentators/players argue for it as well.

My old hyper prostaff + alu power combo absolutely wreaked havoc on my shoulder/elbow back in the day and I figured I'd need a new setup now that I'm not young and invincible.

Got the racquet yesterday with HyperG 1.05 at 51, loving the spin but it's a bit more power than I can control easily. My full yeet forehands are going 4-6 ft longer than I want, whereas I could bring them in relatively easily on Prince Diablo @ 53.

I'm a cheapass doing my own strings on a Gamma ProgII 200, would y'all recommend I throw in a firm poly for the crosses (Isospeed baseline?) or stick with HyperG and tinker with gauge/tension?

"I don't know if it's ""talent"", but there definitely is something really compelling about watching federer compared to watching most other players.

I stopped watching tennis for a while and started not thinking this was the case, but watching again after a couple years, after seeing other players first, was so much more joyful somehow.

Maybe it's just that Federer just plays seemingly lower-percentage tennis and manages to pull it off somehow. Like a Steph Curry (or kyrie sometimes) vs a KD/lebron.

There's just something natural about rooting for someone who's doing stuff that isn't a sure thing -- Nadal's and Djokovic's games are so obviously high-percentage for them; they're perfectly capable of making ridiculous low-percentage shots, but bread-and-butter they apply like a constant high-percentage pressure.

Nadal especially has a ridiculous like ""racket sense""/touch/feel (same as fed) which is reflected in their net games.

Most matches, Tiafoe just straight tries to overpower his opponents in rallies, but you just aren't going to be able to do that Djokovic. Hes too good, you won't overpower him. So instead, Tiafoe is taking a very slow approach to the rallies here. He's had a few points where he has rushed but other than that, he has consistently tried to just get the ball in play. 

Its a much different play style then I'm use to seeing from him, and is a little PCB like, but I think its smart for him. Half the battle to beating players like Djokovic is limiting unforced errors against them, and he's certainly attempting to do that.",tennis

I get him saying/thinking he should be a contender but him saying he is playing better than his peers is a serious red flag IMO.

"I’m in contact with someone who has worked with Kyrgios since he was 18. I’m told that he has never seen Nick this committed to training consistently in the past few months.

For example, he simulated the physical load of playing in the USO during it and AO a few weeks ago. In fact he’s been training hard for AO since October last year. 

Because he came to Melbourne from a green zone (Canberra), he hasn’t had to quarantine. So other than the niggling knee, he is in the best shape he has ever been in, and with no jet lag and quarantine handicap, one of the best prepared going into a grand slam.

He’s also shaken up his management last year which he has not done in a long time, if ever. I’m taking this all in as a sign of his maturity and commitment for the long haul.

We’ve all seen what Nick can do when he’s ‘on’. Now imagine what he could do when that’s backed up with decent training over consecutive months. 

He’s shed off some of the match nerves and anxiety last week that often plagues him on the court, which I take as a positive. 

The question for me that remains is his mental and tactical game. Can he keep his inner demons at bay and refrain from the high-risk low-reward shots that he often trips himself over? If he can cover those bases, I’d be confident on a ‘deep run’ at AO and potential upset at R3.",tennis

"I love Serena, but she isn’t the greatest of all time. Steffi owns her in just about every single career stat. Just because Serena won one more Slam (despite playing ten more years) doesn’t necessarily make her the GOAT. 

Steffi has way more titles (despite playing considerably less tournaments than Serena), way more weeks at #1 (all time record), more years finished as the #1 (all time record), more wins and less losses (again more wins despite retiring at 29 and never playing more than 15 tournaments in a season) and she had a higher peak and level of dominance and consistency than Serena achieved at any point in her career. 

Between 1986 and 1996 Steffi failed to reach the QF of a Slam ONCE and finished ten years in a row in the top 2, 8 of which were at #1. She also reached 13 consecutive Slam finals between 1987 and 1989 (all time record) and won five consecutive Slams including 4 in the same year (1988) by winning all the Calendar Golden Slam, the single most impressive achievement in the history of tennis. She also won 3+ Slam titles in a record FIVE separate seasons and 10+ titles in again a record five seasons. Additionally, between 1987 and 1990 she had a monstrous 305-11 (98%) win rate, an unparalleled level of dominance. She is also the only player ever to win 4 titles at all of the Slams. She won 21 Slams in just 9 years and then her last one three years later before retiring at 29 and all that while competing in 13 (!!!) Slam finals against top ten all time greats in Navratilova, Seles and Evert. 

As amazing as Serena is, she has never played a Slam final against a top 10 all time great and has greatly benefited from perhaps the weakest ever era in the WTA post 2010 in which she won 10 of her Slams. Furthermore, she’s been soooo inconsistent throughout her career (1/3 of her Slam appearances have ended in R1-R4). Not to mention the fact that she only has 73 titles, less than all of the Big 3 and noticeably less than Graf (107), Evert (157) and Navratilova (167). In fact Serena is only 5th in overall titles in the open era and TWELFTH all time. She’s also #5 in terms of win %. Serena has simply never been super consistent for a long period of time and her body couldn’t handle the week in, week out grind of the tour so she saw winning Slams as a shortcut to being in the conversation for GOAT status. However, she lags noticeably behind other all time greats, especially Steffi who has perhaps the most impressive resume out of any player, male or female.",tennis

Alternatively dunno a couple of slams maybe, would have needed to consistently get past 2x of Fed/Rafa/Nole/Andy and that's difficult for those guys, let alone everyone else.",tennis
"Football = ?? 

Eggball = ?? 

Ronaldo or Nadal are the the greatest athletes ever. NOT Tom Brady. Just look at the workload both Nadal and Ronaldo put in all year round. Their greater and demanding schedules not to mention! 

Also, why is it called ‘football’ when you primarily throw? ?????????????",tennis
"I have a similar opinion but for slightly different reasons. He is entertaining but because of his antics and occasional trick shots rather than consistently high quality tennis.

Personally I've seen his matches play out basically the same way for ages and nothing surprises me anymore. I'd rather he just gets on with it lives up to his full potential. However, I understand if you haven't seen a lot of him or are only a casual fan why he seems so exciting to watch.",tennis
"1999 ; she wins the French making Hingis cry, loses the Wimbledon final, and retires over the summer before the US Open at 31 years old.  But, if she had played until her body actually gave out, how many slams would she have wound up with ?

"Felix makes another finals! Really hope he can get over the hump here and take this one. I feel like after he wins that first title, he's just going to hit the ground running. It'll be such a big confident booster for him after coming so close, so many times.",tennis
Can’t believe nick singlehandedly compelled the crowd to revolt against the French State during that match. Yelling “Vive la révolution” during a match is surely a code violation. Throwing let sensors at the umpire and the fans too was not on.,tennis
"I think Zverev and Thiem and Tsitsipas and Medvedev are comparable EX ANTE

But in reality, at least 2 of them will be nowhere near their best and not even reach the quarters and semis. But the other 2 will be going strong and pose a real threat, might even win

In the others column, it's pretty balanced again.

Pretty balanced overall",tennis
"Only technical I’ve seen today was when the guy who beat millman smashed his racket threw a ball into the crowd and told the crowd to get fucked after someone told him to stop sooking like a bitch

"Take the following set of highlights from the Konta vs Juvan match. 

[Highlights here](https://ausopen.com/match/2021-kaja-juvan-vs-johanna-konta-ws124#!media)

In the first set they show a few break points for Juvan to break back to 2-2. Then they skip straight to Konta serving for the set. They miss the crucial break that gives her the lead in the set and really any sense of the story or flow of the match. 

They then go on to show about 30 seconds of the 2 minute highlights announcing that Konta has to retire via injury .... WITHOUT EVEN SHOWING IF SHE GOT INJURED DURING THE MATCH? Or if she exacerbated an injury she already had. 

The limit to 2 minutes is absolutely insane when you consider we got nothing of this match which lasted 12 games. Imagine this for a 5 set match. You gain nothing from watching these highlights at all.",tennis
"Nadal didn't say this in a vaccuum. Sinner and Nadal were quarantine hitting buddies for two weeks, so it wouldn't surprise me if this was Nadal speaking as someone who just became a mentor for Sinner this past month. I think Sinner said something in an interview about how much he learned from working with Nadal.",tennis
"He definitely should have read that better, as well as been able to move to it quicker (I know a lot of players aren't as fit as normal right now).  Was a good quality drop shot, but pretty well telegraphed as well.",tennis
"Honestly parents being managers/coaches should be more frowned upon.

The amount of abusive controlling fathers ive seen standing behind young players is sickening.

I coached kids tennis for awhile and one 11 year old girl had her own brand named cap and tennis gear, she was a state level player and the dad was boarderline abusive while watching her match against the girl I coached.

Keep in mind this was meant to be a friendly match in the school holidays at the school i coached for tennis camp. 

I was 100% ready to lose my job confronting him if he stepped a little bit further. 

The though of enduring that all the way to pro level is sad, its no surprise so many burn out or end up like Tomic who had a similiar well known abusive father.",tennis
"I think Spain will take it but unlike most, I think they’ll win both singles rubbers. Overall I don’t think it will matter as I expect Russia to be too good for everyone from this point. Even if Nadal plays in the final - which I doubt he will.",tennis

"He speaks his mind more openly that others of the big 3. Also Nadal Fed dominate on surfaces where the other one is weak, so there is some kind of a truce between their fan camps. Djokovic is able to dominate everywhere (except against Nadal on clay currently, that is), so he is hated by both other camps.",tennis
"Man, Hsieh is going to make Venus really move around. This is a cracker jack match for sure.

"I think it's ok for him to move on. Not everyone can be one of the big three mutants who can extend their pro careers effectively, for another decade. Lots of top players had already retired, aged, or burned out by 28-30 in past decades.",tennis
"Interesting note: If Medvedev gets to the semis, and Thiem fails to win it all, Medvedev will overtake him for the no. 3 position. Seeing as a Medvedev semis run is fairly likely, and a Thiem win quite a bit less, we could be seeing a new no. 3 at the end of this tournament.",tennis
"Thiem beats Rafa at one slam and at rafas worst tourney at the atp finals in coin flip matches and now he ""OWNS"" Rafa..this sub has become a hyperbole filled vat of morons.

THE SLAMS ARE NOT THE WORLD TOUR FINALS OR MASTERS 1000 EVENTS. Stop extrapolating trends that don't exist..since 2016+ the big play significantly better at the slams than these smaller tourneys.

I actually agree with you but not because of the matchups. It's more his back injury. His press conference did not seem great and I don't think he can win on hc without being healthy..he can win on clay hurt, but that's the main reason.",tennis
"Every time I see his picture, or even his name, I think of him yelling over the mic too loudly, spooking the entire stadium, and doing that little smirk and “oops” gesture with his hand over his mouth. And it never gets old.",tennis
"I've always wanted Kokkinakis to do well, I've liked him as a player since I saw him on 2013 and had huge expectations, few have a record as him regarding injuries and illness at 24 years old.

A small list:

-Groin injury

-Knee injury

-Back injury

-Pectoral injury

-Shoulder injury

-Mononucleosis


To think a player with his talent has played less than 80 ATP (doesn't include Challengers and Futures) matches in 7 years, playing without a clothing sponsorship now is unbelievable. 

I'm really happy he could get a win in the first round and he now has the chance to be playing in Rod Laver Arena in front of his country, hope he can stay healthy. Guy has battled a ridiculous journey, many would've just retired being so young and having so much setbacks, let's go Kokkinakis!


Edit: Let's go 7-6(5) in the first one!

Now going the distance, hold your serve and take it home! Enormous effort, whatever the result he has so many positives to take with him.",tennis
"What are your thoughts on players participating in tournaments the week before a GS? This year, we’ve had a fairly unique situation with deep fields in the ATP cup, Melbourne 1 and 2, also because there was no tournament play before it. I’ve done some quick research and I haven’t found one instance in the last 30 years where a men’s GS winner has won a tournament the week before a GS. What does this mean for Medvedev and Rublev’s chances in this AO? And in general: why do players still play them, assuming they know that a deep run will reduce the chances at winning a GS? Is it a financial decision? And if so, is it fair to let lower ranked players tire each other out in these tournaments so they are more easily beaten in the first week of a GS?",tennis
"Inside part of Humbert’s racket is made up of rubber and outside part is covered by some strings, so all he had to do is touch the ball and it fly to other side of court.. That's the secret why he hitting winners.. ATP wont check his racket bcoz ATP=Big Net=Humbert so dont respect them. Kyrgios will win. Umpire Veljovic injured Tomic. but ATP’s daddy Kyrgios is back. they can't threaten him with French Open seeding to play badly like they did to Uchiyama (Humbert’s last opponent) in the first round.",tennis
"It *was* a good idea when at the same exact time:

&#x200B;

* Djokovic-Tiafoe entered the 3rd set tiebreak
* Venus was receiving treatment on her ankle/knee
* Opelka-Frtiz were simply being *American male* tennis players ;)",tennis
"Well he fools people like he fools himself that he's better than he really is by just not trying. People think a serious effort Kyrgios is unbeatable outside the best in the world. But Nick doesn't try to avoid the embarrassment of having that exposed. Whenever the going gets tough he can just throw a fit and people will say if only he fixed his head, he'd be top whatever. He's overrated imo",tennis
"The awkward moment when there's only four people in the crowd at 1573 arena and I'm one of them.

Another guy has a Belgian flag so we've got at least a two person cheer squad going for Elise Mertens here.

Whoa wait a minute David Goffin showed up in the crowd. Won't bother him though.",tennis
"I think it’s a miscalculation on Sinner’s end. See, once upon a time, When I was 18, I was varsity player for Karate and there are times where I feel like I can sustain a certain intensity for a duration of weeks and would say yes to all engagements and commitments people threw at me, but I always ended up bailing out on some of these because you can’t always control your body when it reaches a certain limit. I wish he learnt his lesson and prioritise GS tourneys next time",tennis
This is an extremely rare occurence. I wonder if it's happened in the last 20 years? The Kitzbuhel final was rained off in 1973 and Nottingham had to cancel one year in the 70s too due to weather. The most famous instance was when a bomb threat resulted in a mid-match cancellation of the 1984 Rotterdam final between Connors and Lendl: [https://www.dagvantoen.nl/bommelding-in-rotterdam-tennisfinale-lendl-connors-gestaakt/?lang=en](https://www.dagvantoen.nl/bommelding-in-rotterdam-tennisfinale-lendl-connors-gestaakt/?lang=en),tennis

I'm sure there would be many this applies to as well, there would be far fewer interstate spectators this year for that reason.",tennis

"Nick’s defo good for the game, no doubt about it... such an entertainer with immense skill! 

Heart breaks for Humbert though, he matured by 5 years in that 5-setter and with that (at times horrid) crowd.. the future of French tennis is bright with this one.",tennis

Bianca - like her tennis but dislike her off court persona. Just comes across as obnoxious 

Zverev - even before the allegations and those just work against him still",tennis

From the Official Grand Slam Rule Book, Article 1, W(3)(d): ""A player may receive on-court medical treatment and/or supplies from
the Sports Physiotherapist and/or Tournament Doctor during any
changeover or set break.""

Receiving bottles of water from your coaches, when copious water and other hydration material is available on-court, does not qualify.

Moreover, according to Article 3, L: ""Players shall not receive coaching during a match (including the warm-up).  Communications of any kind, audible or visible, between a player and a coach may be construed as coaching."" 

Everyone who watched that match watched Novak indicate to his coaches that he needed his special ""water.""

Yes, it was illegal.",tennis
"It's very easy to bet against him this yr tbh.

Back injury plus other threats in his draw than prior years ( other than 2009). Imo he had a bigger chance at this title in 2012( djokovic only threat) and 2014 ( imo he would have beaten Stan but he got hurt).  I don't think there's any world where on paper you could think he's looked more favored than those 2 years",tennis
"Her matches are emotional rollercoasters for the fans. I absolutely hate watching her matches as a fan, but i'm pleasantly surprised when she digs deep and starts playing clinically.

I was joking with a few friends (also fans of Simona) that if she loses we can finally watch the AO stress free.",tennis
"* Hellsing Ultimate *Alucard, one of the protagonist is pretty fucked up. He finds great pleasure in playing with his victims and likes to make them suffer. He's also very OP. It's one of my favorite anime.*

I'd say Your Name is a great choice, the animation is beautiful, it's a good story and the music is amazing :) 

For series, maybe Violet Evergarden, Anohana, Your Lie in April or maybe even Death Note. Death Note is more mind games and strategy with the slightest bit of action. The Promised Neverland S1 is similar.",anime
"I've recently been getting into anime a bit by watching Rev says desu, but I have no idea where to watch it. As Rev himself says, because of the greedyness of the big anime companies, it's better to pirate the anime and buy a bit of merch now and then to support the creators.

I'm not really into fighting anime and I prefer a 3D-ish artstyle, that doesn't run at like 20 fps. I recently watched a Doki Doki let's play, so I think some kind of love story with a bit of drama might be a good place to start. Any suggestions on that?

Edit: I may not have specified enough what I meant by ""3D-ish look""... What I mean is stuff that looks like it could be from a visual novel like Doki Doki, where it doesn't look as hand drawn.",anime

She just wanted to be with her friend, but Rika quickly got blinded by the excitement of having new friends after centuries of talking to the same people.

"A big reason why Satoko acts the way she does is due to her fear of burdening others. She clung to Satoshi and antagonized her aunt until Satoshi killed her, but from her perspective, her aunt was killed by a drug addict and her brother literally ran away from her on her birthday because she couldn't stop burdening him. Especially for a child, that kind of thing is devastating and it would make give her serious self-worth issues. Her big deal in Tatarigoroshi and Minagoroshi was that she didn't want to ask for help because she thought that by silently taking the abuse she wouldn't burden anyone else again.
The feeling of being a burden causes people to change their behavior in many ways. They bottle their feelings up and attempt to deal with most or all of their issues by themselves so they don't involve anyone else in them. They may even push people away rather than allow them to get close and potentially burden them more. Satoko exhibits all of these behaviors and believes that she should generally avoid anything that would affect Rika's enjoyment of her current life, even if she doesn't like it.",anime

Are there any anime like these two? I got recommended lovely complex by someone after watching peach girl... these were both some of that fastest I’ve watched a series. My comfort anime honestly. I’ve watched tons of romance anime but those are in my top 5 for sure. I really loved both the boy characters in these shows and how they were kinda stupid funny  lol I also really loved the main character girls and how they were kinda tsundere. I also really liked the love triangles in both these anime... any recommendations based off these two anime??,anime
"While it's still popular compared to other shows from the same time period, I honestly think the Garden of sinners is under-watched by the anime community.

* The fact that it's a movie instead of a series may be a turn off for people that are used to watching 20 minute long episodes. In general anime movies are under-watched by the community. 
* The second is that it's kind of confusing for casual watchers, it's told in an out of chronological order and you should focus at the details to fully enjoy it. 
* The third is that it's hard to recommend. It's a dark fantasy with murder-mystery, supernatural beings, romance, eastern philosophy, 
* And finally it's being overshadowed by the other fate anime out there.

P.s. If you're interested in watching the Garden of sinners, I recommend watching it in the order of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, recap, 7, 8 to more fully enjoy the series. 

Because they didn't properly adapt movie 6, it feels like a filler episode instead of being part of the main plot so watching it before movie 5 makes it exponentially better.",anime
"**First Timer** - Episode 11

So they are forming communities with old-time slasher movie morals. 

The dream, as well as her room, were rather unexpected. Claymore vibes? Or just 90s fantasy in general I guess. Oh come on, this triangle needs to stop already. As for the hair, does he have control over the cell allocation or is it just lucky?

Bechdel test failed, again. This interaction feels like the male version of Twilight.

Interesting development here with the Yakuza. Are we seeing “good guy vigilante” Parasytes now that feast on criminals? Seems more like they just tried how well they can murder people. No, they just started to switch into the next gear of edge now, huh. Would have preferred the “morally grey” vigilante thing over some mysterious hierarchy of monsters killing for sport.

“Sadoko 2D” is very on the nose. The other movie no idea. Bruh c’mon, not the vegetarian shtick again. Remember when I said the romance was good? Murano is just giving me mood whiplash now. Well this was uncomfortable for me and Shinichi.

The progression seems a bit unbelievable, they are worse together than ever before. Kana might do something stupid now and Murano is incredibly unhappy but of course staying silent. It’s almost like an abusive relationship but I for sure no longer believe that this will be a grand metaphor in the end.

Oh no, the Parasytes have assembled the bobblehead CGI people! And are stealing the spotlight of Greenpeace!

Even though the next plot thread is getting picked up, it feels more and more aimless. Really just makes me want to rewatch The Faculty.

> So when do you think Kana got the second picture of Shinichi?

while he was daydreaming about a world where he could also start drinking like dad

> But why yakuza?

gotta murder some guys brutally but not make the murderer seem instantly and irredeemably evil by making most of the victims students or innocent police officers

> Thoughts on the timing tables being turned on Kana?

Karma. But she seems like she has some asses up her sleeves

> BONUS: Who would've that humans being ruled by a secret cabal of cannibals would becaome a major belief of a US politcal party?

the bodysnatcher thing comes from the Red Scare so it kinda was destined to be with how these beliefs and people that are of this party are drawn to each other",anime
"Accepted the internship offer today, it was kind of an easy decision.

"Copy and pasted my response from another post asking the same question:

Lots of colossal twists that are integrated expertly into a constantly developing plotline. The best I can say without ruining anything is that almost nothing about the world as it's set up in season one is exactly as it seems.

I frequently make the comparison that long television series often have the bad habit of tacking on additional plotlines, new enemies, etc. to keep things fresh each season, but AoT has revelations in later seasons tying into the earlier seasons in a very logical way and gives you the impression that the creator planned the whole series out before even starting, which is probably the case.",anime
"""You girls need to be more prepared!""

""However, I also apologize for not being more responsible and taking a greater interest in your activities, which I'm supposed to supervise"".

*Proceeds to get drunk*

*Proceeds to start a car while drunk*

While this episode does highlight some important factors about camping, such as the fact that it can be quite dangerous if you are underprepared, it is the worst part of the series, including future content (I read the manga up to volume 9, though I won't spoil anything here). Toba-sensei being a drunk is played for laughs, but even here where she shows a caring side, she seems to immediately forget the ""lesson"" she should have learned from this *immediately*.

I still love this series, but this could have been a good opportunity for rare character growth, and it just fumbles it, and I find that really frustrating.

On a similar note while I hate how indecisive harem MCs normally are I'm also realizing how annoying it is that the girls rarely directly tell the MC their feelings. Like at a certain point you gotta realize he doesn't get it. That was probably my favorite part of Tonikawa where the mom and sister point this out to the girl who had a crush on the MC

"Personal reply here

I've never seen Bunnygirl Sempai, but I was ruthlessly bullied to hell as a kid and teenager in school.

Yes stuff like that happens in real life.

I had everything from stuff thrown at me, milk poured on me, stuff stolen from me, rumor about me ""having a hit list"", taunting, teasing, all manner of nicknames and slurs and insults, being assaulted. I was utterly terrified of the Gym locker rooms. 

There was one instance of a guy taking a volume of chobits I was reading and taped it to my back. Mind you this a school library book, school property. He defaced it just to humiliate me.

I was driven to the point of wanting to kill everyone. I was incredibly close to becoming the next ""columbine shooter."" My dad had plenty of guns, unsecured, with ammo I could have easily accessed, and I knew how to use them too.

I have no idea what stopped me, but obviously I'm glad I didn't.

I had homicidal thoughts, was deeply misanthropic, and suicidal for quite some time. A certain moment in my life turned all of that around, but before that by my view of the word was very dark, and it took quite a long time for much of it to fade away. I don't struggle with homicidal or suicidal thoughts anymore, but it shaped my lack in trust of other people that I still can't get past today, And there's still a lot of internalized rage about it still with me to this day. I still don't really trust anyone. Everyone who interacts with me in a positive light, I still think they want something from me or might be deceiving me.

Yes kids are relentlessly bullied, sometimes to the point of suicide, or killing their classmates. It sadly happens more often than you think.

EDIT: So I got contacted by Reddit's suicide help thing. Guys, a lot of shit happened and what not when I was younger, but I got a lot to look forward too now, and I'm on the edge of being able to achieve a dream.

Don't worry about me, I'll be ok.",anime
"Oof, the tension in Satoko checking to see whether she'd got in or not was so damn stressful! The fact that we know that whether she did or not everything would still wind up going wrong just made it worse somehow.

Anyway, mark me down for Team 'it's not Rika's fault, but I totally get why Satoko's spiraling'. Like she says, she worked hard for *years* to get into this school. She invested so much time and effort into passing the exam, solely because she wanted to be with Rika. And while I absolutely don't blame Rika for making new friends or wanting to do her own things, it's pretty obvious that Rika didn't really understand what the difference in their motivations meant realistically. To her, who just wanted to experience new things, there's satisfaction and joy to be found just by being in the school, so it's easier to cope with the work she needs to put in. To Satoko, who only came for her, everything she doesn't like about the school weighs on her even harder because she's not even getting the one thing she's here for. 

I also think it's a little more complicated than just 'Satoko let her pride get in the way of asking Rika for help'. Rika also doesn't seem to know how to balance Satoko with her new friends. Unsurprising, since before they've always had the same friend group and plenty of time together, so she's never had to learn. But she knew Satoko was struggling and not fitting in with the group she'd fallen into - they even insulted Satoko right in front of her - and she still kept prioritizing time with them over her best friend. Rika could have made the choice to spend more time with Satoko one-on-one or speak to her privately, and we never see her doing so. So while it is ultimately on Satoko to actually tell Rika what's bothering her and ask for help (and I'm sure Rika would have been happy to do whatever she could for her)... I get why Satoko felt like she couldn't intrude or say anything in front of Rika's new circle. It's just a really tough situation.",anime

"I’d suggest watching the first episode to get a grasp of how the series is. Food wars is notorious for its fanservice and episode 1 gives you a taste of it. If you’re interested, keep watching. If not, drop it.

Imo, the series peaks up to the end of the second season. Everything from the third season onwards slowly degrades in quality. The final seasons are super rushed in pacing. However, I’d say food wars is highly enjoyable all throughout.

But I am looking for recommendations for any others like these and Madoka, that at least do a decent job. I know a lot tried to copy Madoka and failed pretty bad, I'd consider what I saw of Magical Girl Site a failure. But wanted to know of ones that at least get close to doing it as right as Madoka did.

"I honestly did not expect to see [Kumoko making a house with her food.](https://i.imgur.com/r5npQwT.png)

[Damn her new form really looks cool.](https://i.imgur.com/W1F27OE.png)

So now she has two minds, I guess I should not be surprised as they showed multiple versions of her in the OP and in the show's visuals. 

When I heard that Julius' team was hunting a spider monster I honestly thought for a moment that they were searching for Kumoko's mom.

And that they finding [those three](https://i.imgur.com/M1S3YTN.png) and the [Nightmare's Vestige](https://i.imgur.com/D0F6Iq6.png) was just coincidental. I honestly wasn't expecting to see a non-reicarnated monster that could talk to people. 

For the looks of it, it doesn't seem like the demon lord is inside that dungeon, so I wonder how and why she killed the Nightmare's Vestige? Well, my guess is that she has a skill as the one Kumoko has deactivated to find it and that she killed it because she has some plans that involve keeping Julius alive.
 
You know, although I already expected it to happen, I honestly didn't think that Hugo was going to become so unhinged this early.",anime
"The only one that comes to mind is Paranoia Agent.  The MC's dog does get hit by a car, but not because of a thrown ball.  It's pretty graphic with a long trail of blood on the road.  The timing also matches up with it airing on Adult Swim in 2005.

"Personal thoughts of the top 10:

1. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood:

>A very enjoyable series with a satisfying ending and likeable characters. I enjoyed it quite a lot.

2. Attack on Titan: The Final Season

>One of my favourite anime but I prefer S3P2 so far.

3. Steins; Gate:

>One of the greatest first episodes in TV to be honest, after that it has a slow pace with the second half being much better. I genuinely dislike most of the cast but Kurisu and Okabe carry the show. I enjoy it but nowhere near the amount everyone else does.

4. Gintama

>Haven't seen it. Only clips.

5. Hunter x Hunter:

>Very inconsistent show. Sometimes I love it and other times I am so uninterested. Gon is a terrible MC luckily Killua is a great character. I felt satisfied with the ending eventhough the manga continues. One of my favourite battle shounens.

6. Legend of The Galactic Heroes:

>Temporarily on hold.

7. March Comes in Like a Lion: Season 2:

>Great series although sometimes it's hard to watch because it can be a tad depressing.

8. Clannad: After Story:

>First half of the season is awful. Two random arcs no one cares about, but after the halfway point it is incredible and has two of my favourite episodes in anime, episodes 18 and 19.

9. Owarimonogatari: Second Season:

>As someone who dislikes Monogatari I will say this season had its moments. When the fanservice isn't present and when Araragi is less creepy (when he isn't narrarating the story) it can be okay.

10. Code Geass: R2

>I think everyone just remembers the ending and forgets how bad season 2 as a whole is.",anime

"My opinion, to start things off: yes, it's an isekai, albeit a pretty unusual one. We have an ordinary, relatable protagonist who's implied to have had a rough life (Rakka) transported - likely by reincarnation, even - to a new, fantastical home that's cut off from her origins (Glie). She develops traits of the fantasy world (wings and halo) and learns to live happily there. I'd love to hear what you guys think!",anime

"Certainly there's more to this, right? I still doubt this is enough to push Satoko into wanting to kill Rika. Even then, if the stuff we've seen here is any indication of Satoko's motivation, then I think even Takano is more redeemable because Satoko's rejected Rika's help so now it's all on her.",anime
"Blood manipulation is a cool Cursed Technique, I can see why it’s so valued. I imagine the prep work for that has gotta suck. I mean, blood only has a shelf life of 42 days outside of your body so Kamo has got to be getting drained at least once a week, but normally the Red Cross makes you wait a full 56 days before donating blood again. Maybe his Cursed Technique makes it easier for him to replenish his own blood.

Miwa is adorable. Useless, but definitely adorable. 

The idea of trained cursed spirits is interesting. I’m curious how exactly you train a cursed spirit and how docile you can get them. I imagine it’s more difficult with higher grade spirits, so a semi-first grade must have taken a while to train. But I guess that doesn’t really matter anymore because Mahito, Hanami and… uh, Coat Rack guy are here. Hanger Rack guy seems like he won’t be too much of a problem, Mahito is basically invincible to anyone other than Yuji and is really fucking dangerous now that he has his Domain Expansion, and Hanami seems like a real handful. He probably doesn’t have the raw killing power that Mahito and Jogo, but from what we’ve seen it seems like he has a lot of utility, crowd control and damage absorption. 

Jeez, is there a woman in a big name Sorcerer Clan who doesn’t get treated like shit? I hope that aspect gets more focus later, JJK does a really good job of handling it’s female cast and I’ll always have a soft spot for badass women showing up sexist assholes in positions of authority.

Megumi’s elephant is cool. I’m looking forward to it becoming a staple of his arsenal that he can use for extended periods of time alongside his other creatures rather than just a trump card that he can use very briefly.

I gotta be honest, if I was creating a story, I would never want to include a character as busted as Gojo without giving him a crippling weakness. Normally with characters who have powers as strong as Gojo, there is a convenient, reliable way for you to nerf them hard. For example, Superman being weak to Kryptonite or All Might having his injury and time limit. But Gojo doesn’t have anything like that, so you have to create new ways for him to just not automatically solve whatever problem the heroes are dealing with. I’m honestly convinced that a large part of why Nanami was even introduced was to give Yuji a mentor who couldn’t just one shot every problem to allow for the whole Vs Mahito arc to happen. I heard that Gege joke about hating Gojo and I kinda get why. It must be tricky to come up with new ways for Gojo to get excluded from the action.

If a person wanted to, they could really dig down into the mystery of what's going on and come up with some good theories.

And the foreshadowing makes it good for rewatching/reading since you'll pick up on things that you might have missed the first time through.

As someone who lives way outside colder climates (anything under 5 degrees Celsius is news worthy here) this is the funniest reminder that outdoor activities below freezing requires some thought before going out. I’m pretty sure that I would end up like our girls here (especially Chiaki *ahem*) had I didn’t realise how cold those days could be. Heck at least they aren’t getting snow or heavy rain that day (both pretty common in Japan in winter) or I’m sure they could be in real danger!

Props to Shimarin who actually remembered how cold those areas around Mt. Fuji gets to at first instinct - I again certainly won’t made the connection unless there’s a snowstorm heading in!

In other news looking at these rich girls I’m now not so sure that I would bought that light chair at $US 100+ LOL, I definitely have to think about that one and certainly I have no money to buy all 3 of them!

That other family is literally living in heaven, having such a comfortable tent with wood burning stoves outdoors. I don’t think I have much interest (to me camping is but part of other things, usually I would only imagine camping for things like stargazing or hiking to somewhere else - and it’s been some years since I last did that). Love that Corky dog and model plane with floats (never saw such a thing despite me living within 30 minutes of walk from a reservoir dam where lots of people fly model planes on there) though!

I think as soon as people heard there was going to be anime canon they give up on the season. It’s always confusing when anime only watchers complain about not following the manga. To be honest it’s not as good as the first season but it is as bad as people make it out to be.,anime

Also, here in the states, if you're intoxicated like Sensei is, turning on your vehicle and sit in the drivers seat can technically get you hit with a DUI.  Highly unadvised even if it's on private property.   The issue is that when you're drunk, you're not in complete control of all of your facilities, including your ability to think clearly.  Obviously, odds are extremely slim that a police officer is patrolling a camp site in search for drunk drivers, but there's always the chance that one may pass by see a parked vehicle operating while idle in a parking lot and check on the vehicle to make sure the occupants are okay.",anime

"I love how all the girls are focused intently on taking the final exams and Nino is the one thinking to herself how she obviously can't be in love with Futaro. A tsundere at her finest.

Miku is getting ready for Valentine's Day by making sure she makes the perfect chocolate for Futaro, and Ichika ends up roping the only one of the girls who can cook, Nino, into helping her get it right. Of course Nino doesn't mince words when it comes to how bad Miku's cooking is, but even she can't deny the earnest feelings behind them. 

Itsuki is really dedicated to the Nakanos' mom, from fulfilling her role in the family to visiting her grave on the same day she died every month. I feel like that kind of focus on your mother can be a little unhealthy, but talking with one of her mom's former students seems to have inspired Itsuki to find her own path with her own motivations instead of just emulating her mom. 

Shark-teeth glasses lady offered up a nice peek into the Nakanos' mother, a beauty who was harsh and cold to her students, but whose gorgeous looks and dedication to her career led her students to admire and love her. Particularly one former delinquent who cleaned up her act and became a teacher herself . 

Ichika is trying to play wingwoman for her sister all the while hiding her own feelings for Futaro, and even Miku realizes it (and that Nino might like Futaro too), and her own attempt to let go of her feelings is pulled out from under her as she gets to go on a book shopping date with Futaro and Futaro's caring reminds her once again why she can't stop liking him. And then she ends up one-upping Miku and technically ""beating"" her on the finals, which Miku was planning to use to build up to her confessing to Futaro, and whether intentionally or not Ichika makes her move for the battle for Futaro.

I'm kind of surprised Ichika's picture of herself in the future looked a little like Yotsuba.

It turns out Yotsuba used to have long hair, which honestly surprisingly worked for her, and that she's the reason the Nakano's had to transfer schools. They all failed but all but Yotsuba actually passed the retest, but they wouldn't leave Yotsuba behind so they switched schools, which once again goes to show how far the sisters are willing to go for each other. And Futaro acknowledges Yotsuba's feelings and realizes the best way for the sisters to learn is to help each other with their specialties, and finally validates Yotsuba's feelings and confidence in herself . 

You thought Ichika in nothing but a shirt was a nice sight? Have you seen Miku in her PJ's with her chest practically popping out and her shoulders exposed? To be honest, I'm kind of surprised she didn't freak out at Futaro seeing her like that, but it's not like he could nosebleed any more than that.

They did it! They all passed! Shame for Miku, but still better than failing. Kind of wondering where Nino went though.",anime
"I still hope that the show will some day explain how the timeline of all this stuff works. 

Kumoko was born maybe months ago, but the other kids are all teenagers now. Therefore it would've made sense if the spider that the Hero just fought was Kumoko, but no author would do a timeskip for a protagonist that is still progressing so rapidly and has so much stuff to learn and experience (plus this spider just died, so it's still not our Kumoko).
So the timeline doesn't make any sense in my head, because I seriously don't think that the Demon Lord we got a glimpse of is our MC, but Kumoko has to be *somewhere* in the present when the other kids are in school.

This is just me rambling about the timeline of this show, please don't spoil me.",anime

"One of Higurashi's primary themes is managing mental health, reaching out when you need help and not allowing your feelings to stew. Leaving things up to the dice of fate doesn't allow you to take any steps forward, and so far Satoko is just leaving everything up to fate and being dragged around by the flow.

Twice she essentially said ""It's just a phase"" when Rika wanted to study, and when Rika wanted to socialize with her high society classmates. While she let herself be dragged in by Rika's studying she didn't even try to join her friends social circle. Rika tried to extend a hand to help her study but Satoko batted that away. Rather than reaching out, she's turning inward and letting her persecution complex get the better of her again.

Normally I'd have been on board with this being a trigger of Hinamizawa Syndrome, she has everything she needs to go back to the state she was when her parents died, but last episode heavily hinted that HS is tied directly to Hanyuu and has been disappearing as of late. I'm a little worried that they're going to bring in the 'Outbreak' logic of another regional 'parasite', but I think it's more likely a meddling witch shows up and gives Satoko a certain offer.

I am a little worried though tbh, theres a very specific way I see this going that satisfies me as a massive Higurashi and Umineko fan, but it can also very easily go to shit and ruin the perfect ending Higurashi had by not justifying Satoko enough. [Umineko/Higurashi Theory/Spoilers](/s ""IMO, Satoko has to become Lambdadelta. Lambda is obsessed with Bern, and is known to have trapped her in a hopeless game, exactly whats happening in Gou. It probably starts innocently enough, Satoko fueled by her warped desire to monopolize Rika takes a witch's offer to become a looper and prevent Rika from leaving. 1000 years of looping will warp anyone beyond recognition though and will remove the characters from Rika and Satoko and make them Bern and Lambda. Ideally they also play the 'this is only one fragment' card to leave the cat-box of Higurashi open. Tying Higurashi directly to Umineko means that Higurashi doesn't have a happy ending, and maybe that's accurate given its mental health themes where theres never a neat bow at the end of it but I'd still like to believe in the happy future of Matsuribayashi"")",anime

Tomozaki just calling Haruka cute out loud without realizing means Haruka's definitely an integral party in this ship wars now. 

Tomozaki is helping Mimimi partially because Hinami told him to, and partially because of his gamer desire to beat Hinami. But maybe he could also be doing it to show Hinami he can be a better campaign manager than Mizusawa, who she chose.

So when the school asked the students and families for donations to install ACs in the classrooms a few months later, most of the donations came overwhelmingly from the 1st to 4th years, with the 1st years contributing a whopping 40% of the donations, while the 5th to 6th years were less enthusiastic, as they were about to graduate and had little incentive to donate for something that they weren't able to enjoy.

PS History buff rant: Hey, I instantly knew it was John Adams before Mimimi gave the answer away. For some reason, I could memorize the names of the first few US presidents until Jackson, and then a massive blank until the 20th century, with only Lincoln being prominent amongst the 19th century presidents. America becoming a superpower after WWII means it's hard to forget or ignore who their presidents' were.",anime

"I've actually got something for this.  Need to remove the MLB specific things


- 9 innings (some leagues it'll be 7)
- Both teams alternate offense and defense in those nine innings
- Three outs for a team in each inning.
- Three strikes in an out.
- 9 batters, 9 fielders
- Home team bats last
- Goal is to score more runs and than the opposing team
- They're not points, they're runs.
- A run is earned by a player completing a trip through all 4 bases within an inning.
- If a game is tied at the end of the 9 innings, they continue to play ""extra innings"".  The innings are exactly the same as the first 9 except who ever has the lead at the end of the inning wins the game.
- The area with the sand/dirt is the ""infield""
- The large grass area beyond the infield is the outfield.
- The diamond is the 4 bases, home, 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
- Home isn't technically a ""base"", as it is called a ""plate"".
- The player between 2nd and 3rd is called the ""Shortstop"".  The guy in the middle is the pitcher.
- The blind stooges in black are the ""umpires"".
- The white lines that spread out from homeplate are the foul lines.  The bright yellow poles at the ends of those lines are the foul poles.  Balls that land on the outside are considered foul and considered a strike if not caught by a fielder (in which case it would be an out).
- A pitch is the action of the pitcher throwing the ball at homeplate to the catcher.
- The strike zone is the area directly over the homeplate from knee height to the belt.  Anything outside of that space is considered a ""ball""... except for those blind people wearing black who can call balls and strikes out they see fit.
- 4 balls is a walk.  The batter is awarded first base if they get walked.
- If a batter is hit, by a pitch, they are awarded first base like a walk.
- No one really knows what a balk is.
- The DH a ""designated hitter"", and is a player that only bats in place of the pitcher and never fields.  Depending on the league, a pitcher may be the batter.
- The ""head coach"" in baseball is called a ""manager"".


Anything else is going beyond the basics.  It all makes more sense if you watch a game or two.

Edit: I love baseball.",anime

I believe my anxiety is related with the fact that, because I don't enjoy the hobby anyone I don't have a way to disconnect. I used to force myself to enjoy. Now I learn to let it go by having a back up hobby or a day or two without many stimulus (no background music, couple of walk in silence, that sort of thing). I hope that helps",anime

"I've over time come to consider it the later. Although a character can be interested and have good development, there is bound to be another one created in another medium that is handled much better. While many people often dislike a main character for being ""generic"" or ""bland"" they kind of miss the point that it is really the chemistry of the main character with the rest of the cast that really makes the show. Even the most interesting characters, whether main or not, stand out best with the other cast.

Thank god, we're in a shojo anime now. Fields of flowers, a prince on a white horse with a regal bearing and a kind smile. Now we just need the Sword of Dios... 

Wait, that was just Kana having a dream. But we still get the romance plot. Kana's after Shinichi, but she's too late. He's already with Satomi and takes her out on a nice date while only being a little psychotic. Just a little and only like twice, I'm sure it's nothing. 

The parasites are getting organized. One of them busts up a yakuza house by himself, then calls another ""boss"". He and the boss appear to be working on a political campaign. By 2021 we've established that people will vote for a lot of nonsense, so I like their chances.

The ferris wheel scene was beyond adorable. Seriously the music during that scene was so good. This show has such a great soundtrack. 

In the previous episode the Dad did mention something about Fuutaro being a support for a female tutor. That woman Itsuki was talking to was a teacher and cram-school teacher. I'm guessing we're going to see more of her.",anime

**Episode 18 Thoughts**

* I know theyre just sleeping, but actually seeing the sea people hibernating is a bit unsettling
* Hikari is scared, but no reason to blow up at Miuna like that
* Having Hikari's moms picture there kind of watching over his dad while he's asleep feels a bit surreal...and I'm not sure why
* Wow I'm moved to tears like Miuna was...that school must have looked magnificent when students were still going
* So Uroko was accusing Miuna of not being honest with what she truly wants
* Yikes...a collection of Ojoshi-samas from what I assume were from the past Ofunehikis...that's a bit harrowing
* Ohhh nonononono...it makes so much sense that Manaka would be there :((
* Damn...what a nightmarish turn of events, so much happened in that second half...they found Manaka, but I feel like things are being thrown into further disarray.

**Episode 19 (The Lost, Lost Little...) Thoughts**

* Sea flora and fauna would be so fun to explore
* Such a beautiful monologue by Chisaki at the beginning here
* Ah phewwww looks like Manaka is healthy for now...what a relief
* AND LOOK WHO THE NURSE IS! YOU GO CHISAKI
* Hikari showing his concern for Manaka to such a degree has got to be so conflicting for Miuna...she loves Hikari, but at the same time she's in love with the Hikari that loves Manaka :((
* Chisaki DEFINITELY saw herself in Miuna there. I find the relationship between the two fascinating, even though they dont actually speak to each other that much
* Nooooo I wanted to hear what Gramps was gonna say...can always depend on him to drop some lore
* I see Kaname's point, but Tsumugu is being pretty pragmatic about what happened. I think Kaname is correct from his point of view, but you gotta think about the real world ramifications too
* Oh no Chisaki....she's really flexing her fits this episode LOL
* I'm cracking uppppp...I have no words, Chisaki oh noooo she got finessed by Tsumugu I love this so much
* The tension between Kaname and Tsumugu is unparalleled my goodness. We get a Tsumugu confession (not to Chisaki directly), and I feel like Kaname is having a difficult time justifying Tsumugu as someone he should dislike. Tsumugu has absolutely done and said all the right things thus far
* No hangover, you say huh?
* Really really cool how they bookended this episode with Chisaki's memory of Hikari leading her by hand...that was awesome to see!
* I'm worried...it doesnt look good for Manaka, even if she wakes up she might not have Ena
* Not sure why Hikari thinks Uroko will help them, but I do think Uroko is a more complex character than he may be letting on

"[I love that they immediately brought up the issue with the wheels.](https://i.imgur.com/OEFWGpW.png) This was my concern last week. How are they going to go around unpaved roads with a wooden wheel? [Didn't think they'd make bamboo weave tires](https://i.imgur.com/1s4fz13.png) but it's a pretty elegant solution.

[So they're just setting up a nearby outpost first?](https://i.imgur.com/xjxzLb0.png) I thought they were already on their way for the actual attack. I guess that makes sense. Also the tank is nowhere near what it looks like in the OP yet.

[Great Detective Suika on the case!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ9B04c.png) Good thing majority of the people Tsukasa has revived are all dumb gorillas. Someone would've probably spotted her if there were more like guys like Ukyo.

[This legit made me laugh out loud!](https://i.imgur.com/WgQ4uGW.png) It took Myne ages to perfect her paper, testing out various materials but here Senku just did it in a 5 second montage by using weeds they've found by the river. Well he did have access to sodium hydroxide so he really had the bigger advantage xD

[Now it's much more closer to what the one in the OP looks like!](https://i.imgur.com/1rBvHNg.png) Looks like there's going to be a few more upgrades left.

"There's one episode that adapted a side story from volume 4.5.  The anime adapted the first 3 volumes.  Because this side story featured a character who's involvement would make no sense whatsoever without also adapting volume 4, they instead replaced her role with the only other female character that would make sense in that context.

It...did not go over well, to put it mildly.  The character who got replaced ended up being easily the most popular of the female cast, and a lot more important to the story than expected at the time.  People can point out other minor quibbles (and they are minor, the adaption did a fine job otherwise), but the backlash to the pool episode is what killed the anime.",anime

"Back when Dr. Stone came out, I only watched 2 episodes. It wasn't bad, but not interesting enough to keep me going. I didn't drop the series per se, but put it indefinitely on hold until this season.


As s2 was about to come out, I decided to give the series another shot. From episode 7 on, I was basically hooked. [More specifically](/s ""Kohaku and the village made the story a LOT more engaging."")


EDIT:


I also stopped watching Koutetsujou no Kabaneri once the plot started to go downhill in the series. Recently, I decided to finish it in order to give the movie a try.


My hope was that the movie would focus on the more interesting aspects of the show and it was definitely worth it. Great animation, action, and character development. The fact that it's not even an 8 on MAL makes me think it's pretty underrated. Had the main series not taken such a drastically different path from what the series initially promised, I think the movie would have been a lot more well received.",anime

Minimi is just so damn adorable. I love her drive and desire to be #1, also her quirky personality. It’s cool that Tomozaki is helping her, because she’s exactly the type of person to help him develop more.

Every episode I’m seeing more and more improvements out of tomozaki which is great too. The video game analogies in this series work really well with the concept of social development/interaction.

"> What is Roswall's objective. 

Unknown.

>Why is he the enemy of subaru here. 

Unknown.

>Why Garfiel is an enemy at first ? then he becomes his ally?

He doesn't want anyone to liberate the Sanctuary because he's angry at the outside world. But he was ultimately convinced by Subaru and the trial to give it another chance. (S2P2).

> What is echidna's purpose

Echidna is the patron of the Sanctuary (the person it was built for) so she runs all of the trials.

>Why is she helping subaru? 

She wants to experience interesting things, and she thinks Return By Death is just *super* interesting, so she wants Subaru to enter an exclusive contract with her. (S2P1 Ep 11).

Even though her obsessive personality pushes Subaru away, she still wants him to like her so she helps him out even though they aren't on great terms anymore. (S2P1 Ep 12).

>Why the witch of envy helps him at the end? 

Unknown.

*But*, we can speculate. It seems like the Witch of Envy gave Subaru his power to protect him from throwing his life away in this new world. For some reason, she really wants the best for him. (S2P1 Ep 12).

"Obligatory Gokigen'y?\~

Even though my knowledge of Umineko is very little, St. Lucia just reeks of Umineko vibes. I really hope that after GOU, there will be a proper Umineko adaptation since I heard the Deen one sucked balls. 

The shit that's happening this episode is very real, I don't know if prestigious schools as bad as this still exist today but in 1987 it most definitely would have. I can sympathize with Satoko, she tried to be considerate of Rika even though that kind of life isn't for her just so she can be with Rika but there's only so much you can bear for someone I guess. What she's doing is wrong though but I understand it. Now let's see how insane she'll go.",anime
"A story like that is a mix of different genres, two main ones are Dementia and Supernatural, there are also demons so it is kind of a mix of Dementia and supernatural genres, with demons as a third and could possibly be an optional one.

"I was expecting Satoko to fail, but her being out of place in a prestigious school was even better. Fantastic episode. Through no malevolence of her friends, Satoko loses her place in the club in Hinamizuwa or by Rika's side at the new school.

I don't think we will get enough answers to explain the first time loop, or everything involving Takano and the military, but I think its fine, we have enough to serve as a backdrop to Satoko turning evil and wanting to trap Rika. Though it would be cool if we got an explanation of how she managed to get each loop to play out the way it did.",anime

"Mappa is fucking GOAT'd for the decade. This animation gave me Demon Slayer chills. The story gives me League of Villain vibes. The characters are so on point it hurts. Fushigoro was literally playing around with this man Kamo. And Kamo is so dedicated to his true family even after posing the question of why his mom isn't treated more fair, he still years later can't understand why he therefore is. The cold reality of ""you have powers, the one we wanted didn't"" sucks so bad. He doesn't *actually* want to kill Itadori. Man. Kyoto school really ain't have it pretty either. Are all Jujutsu sorceress prone to some type of suffering? Either way this content gives me hope and excitement in anime that I haven't felt before. The fucking principal is a rockstar.

"Hi- I would really like to get some help about this. I watched an anime when I was around 6 (roughly 2008-2011) and I don't remember the name of it. I watched it on either Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon, there were Bakugan-like mechs and there was 1 character (grey-haired) who used to be on the good side but was abducted, held underground somewhere and cloned as a bad guy. When the original good version of the character regains consciousness he briefly teleports to the good guys says help me and teleports back to his prison.

"Here's two completely different shows about these themes:

Monster across its 74 episodes deals a lot with the nature of depression and suicide. This show is largely a set of character studies on how trauma can break people in so many different ways. Of all the psychological shows I've watched, this is the most deserving of the tag.

The main antagonist of Monster is a man who is an expert at manipulating people using their darkest, most closely held emotions and experiences as fuel. With a character like this, you naturally get a lot of focus on what it really takes to drive someone to take their own life.

A Silent Voice is overall a much more uplifting story that still really treats these topics with a lot of respect. It's a more everyday depiction of depression and suicide, dealing with topics like bullying rather than serial killers. If Monster is the show that depicts in a variety of ways the very worst, weakest, most forlorn side of humanity, then A Silent Voice is a movie that shows how depression can affect anyone at all.",anime

A heads up: the second season loses a bit of the charm of the first season and feels a bit too ""anime-y"" if that makes sense. It's still fun to watch, though. Also, the series ends with Season 2 but the story keeps going in the manga.

For romance: Toradora! (series) and 5 Centimeters per Second (movie). These two are on opposite ends of the romance spectrum, with the former incorporating humor and the latter being a bit more serious and melancholic.",anime
"I'm confused by how time looping works. If Rika dies, a new world happens. If Satoko dies, a new world also happens? Are they suddenly transported consciously into some sort of world that is birthed upon either of them dying?",anime
"[Heat Guy J](https://files.catbox.moe/3fxxrc.webm) shoulda been big, but it flopped because they aired it on MTV2 late night when no one was there to see it. good dub.

[Key the Metal Idol](https://files.catbox.moe/13khtf.webm) came out at the same time as evangelion and was a big influence for anime like serial experiments lain, but despite this it is very under watched. good dub also.",anime
"For me it's a 10/10, it had flaws but the high points were so high that in my opinion it basically overshadowed everything. The reason I'd give it a ten is becuase whilst it's not as consistent as something like FMAB. It's high points are so high that shows like FMAB could only dream of touching those heights. So I think that equals out. I think code geass has the second best ending in anime as well.(behind Assassination classroom)",anime

"> the rent a girlfriend service could technically have found a loophole that lets them become digital pimps.

So, supposedly, it's worse for a prostitute to be freelance than to work for a pimp, because a pimp will protect their assets (because not doing so ruins reputation and potential profits), whereas freelance sex working means you have no one to back you up in the event something happens (like if someone were to get violent or refuse to pay).",anime
"For an elf, Vashelle sure has some crap naming sense to name a talking lion **Tiger**son.

For an ecchi harem anime, this episode is tame as the focus is on Noir befriending a talking lion rather than harem shenanigans. Thankfully, the post-ED Alice segment makes up for it, thank goodness it's becoming a regular segment.

I get the feeling Alice knew exactly what she was doing with Tigerson's tulip, especially the way she's yanking it. XD ~~(Probably for her to ""practice"" lol )~~",anime
"Fanservice (as in just pleasing/pandering the audience) isn't bad by definition. It's just something the author decides to give to give you. A good writer knows how, when and if fanservice should be included to further the story. The main issue with FS is that is overused in anime.

Anyway I recommend:

 Horimiya

Oregairu

Toradora

Kaichou wa Maid-sama

Nana

Hachimitsu Clover

Adachi And Shimamura

Given

Wotakoi

"Hmm gotta be Tohru from fruits basket for female character because I stumbled across fruits basket when I was fairly young and I thought she was such an inspirational character how she just got through shit living in an actual tent in the woods like what a trooper and shes just so wholesome I aspired to be like her, would love one of her cuddles too ?? it's rare I like female characters since they're usually massive stereotypes or just plain annoying (yup one of those women that hate women) but I have a soft spot for her! 

For Male character I'd probs only go with Levi from AoT because everytime I know hes getting battle screen time I get so hyped cause hes such a badass (same reason I like Mikasa too). His actually personality is a little one dimensional I guess but I like that in a way cause I know to expect him to be consistently cold and logical with some real loyalty too!",anime

"For me its Natsuki Subaru from Re:Zero. 

Subaru is known for suffering terrible deaths over and over and over and yet he cannot share a thing. He gets to see all his friends murdered in front of him yet he doesn’t have the strength to save them. He is weak and pathetic and dumb and can sometimes make you hate his guts for his scummy attitude yet you can’t help but sympathize with him for all the things he has to go through. I know many people on the internet seem to hate him and give him so much crap for being useless, dumb, not strong enough, not smart enough, arrogant, prideful, weak, crybaby, and for rejecting “best girl” in their eyes. And you know what’s funny, is that he actually says and feels all of this about himself too! And I quote, “I have no strength, but I want it all. I have no knowledge, but all I do is dream, There’s nothing I can do, but I struggle in vain!” And another quote that I really like is, “All I do is talk a big game, and make myself sound like a big shot, when I can’t do anything! I never do anything yet I can complain like a pro. Who do I think I am?! It’s amazing that I can live like this and not feel ashamed!” what I love about Subaru is that he recognizes his own faults and tries his best to change and better himself, to which he does in the end. He also recognizes that his obsession for Emilia is toxic and wants to change that not just for her sake but for his sake as well. And for a fact, he does make up for most of his faults In the end of season 1. He is a hero yet nobody can see what he has to through to become that hero. Not to mention how relatable he is. He is probably one of the most relatable characters I ever witnessed in fiction. And that’s why is one of my favorite characters. I can go on and on about why I love his character so much but that will be too long to type. That’s how amazing he is!",anime

"**First-time watcher**

Well, this time, it's about the nature of creative work, pretty much. It's not something that you can just force out of yourself, pressure yourself into - it takes the proper mood and environment, and giving yourself enough room to breathe for the creative juices to flow. As the record store owner says, the silence, the breaks, the *lack* of ""trying hard"", can be just as important, and as Dera says, it's not something that just comes from the brain, it takes the right feeling too. It can be something of a leap of faith to throw yourself into, but if you can persevere and keep your cool, the result might just turn out to be something beautiful. Even without looking it up, I can tell that this episode was directed by Naoko Yamada herself (leg shots! repeated mini-skip-ahead in the character interactions! talking over a beautiful still frame of the kitchen!), and I wonder if she was drawing from her own experiences here, like starting out as a director on K-On at only the age of 25. I certainly hope that her own environment was and has been as friendly and supportive as the girls and Dera are toward Midori here! A nice ""pay-it-forward"" detail: In Shiori's episode, she was discovered in the bathroom by Midori too nervous to talk to Tamako, and in this episode, she discovers Midori overly nervous about the performance. And in both cases, the discoverer talking to the others about it ultimately solved the problem.

One negative I do need to bring up: I've already been critical of the handling of Choi, and this episode doesn't do much to change that. While it's nice to have those cultural parallels/universals with dance and such brought up, as well as her being able to help the girls in multiple ways with her skills, even after several in-universe months she's little more than the exotic background character, lacking in meaningful interactions with the rest of the cast besides Dera. In fact, there's two more ""exotifying"" moments in this episode with the TV (haha trash shows so fascinating!) and her revelation about/deference to Tamako. Simply put, while it's hardly mean-spirited, it shows that even the younger generations in Japan have some ways to go when it comes to cultural sensitivity - as I already wrote once, it's more like what one might see in Western comics of the 70s-80s.",anime
"I’m pretty new to anime actually. I watched all of DBZ and Super + a little of gt and the original Dragon Ball. Also watched up to episode 76 of Hunter X Hunter, but the rest isn’t on Funimation and was just wondering if anyone new the reason. I know it’s 10 years old so it all should be dubbed by now. I just really want to finish it without it being in Japanese.",anime
"I think I'm going to mostly quit anime (for now at least). Had a wake-up call today which made me realize I need to focus on other things and do whatever I can to enable that. Anime has been a huge part of my identity for a long time, but I spend a lot of time watching it to the point of prioritizing it over more important matters. In the end it's gotten me nowhere in terms of life, so I think it's best to go on a diet. Of course, I'll still be watching Attack on Titan until the end :D",anime

"So ""farm of handsome boys"" is literally ""farm of handsome boys"". Quite a dark interpretation of the episode title eh? Not surprisingly those Briheight testing on people goes with both empires and we got a side episode focusing on this.

Our heroic handsome boy Bruh (*bruh?*) really helped this time with his bold attitude in accepting Back Arrow and others even if they have never met before and the latter could have easily been someone from Lutoh. He and his mates are lucky that they got someone who sided with neither of the two big powers here, though Back Arrow was really on the brink of being unreliable too to be honest. That faked surrender was really a *bruh* moment.

Hopefully our Granedgar villagers can learn how to make full use of their new mobile village soon, because they are barely touching most of its functions till now. Luckily our girls Elsha and Altee are learning well (not you, Bit) and unless Shu Bi defects again later they are in good hands. It seems unlikely soon though now with Kai going long lengths as to seeking revenge against Shu Bi defecting against Rekka.

Looks like I'm the only Team Elsha member here eh?

Well this is indeed quite a filler episode, it's a good one but not exactly inspiring at the first quarter point. That said, many of the most famous mecha shows barely get into the orbit after one-quarter (see Gurren Lagann for one), and the world building keeps up at a steady pace so far. With them seemingly hitting the Wall next (see next episode's title), looks like we'll hit a turning point of the story very soon.

I waited a few weeks and watched the first episode but for some reason I only got 5ish minutes into the second episode before turning it off and never coming back to it until last week where I saw the s3 visual and binged the whole show in a few days and really enjoyed it. 

I wouldn’t say because I disliked the show. I believe I really enjoyed the time that I originally watched when s1 aired. Maybe it was because I somewhat had some kind of nostalgia towards the original that I was worried that I wouldn’t like it as much or it wouldn’t live up to my expectations.  In fact when I rewatched it, I had to push myself to power through episode one as it was still at the back of my head. 

I was wrong however, quite a bit and I wish I had watched it sooner. Can’t wait for the final season, I’m glad that I only have to wait a little while for it to start.",anime
"It starts off with the Mc saying everyone in this world has powers except for me, and everyone makes fun of him for it but not a lot. Then through out the show it starts to reveal his past and how a he transferred from a school he got expelled from by defeating everyone in the school with his op powers and he keeps trying to hide his past from people and he has a cold attitude the more people find out, and then eventually the old school tracks him done and challenges to fight him, and he defeats all of them again by himself. It was on Netflix in either 2013 or 2014? Then the removed it and I can’t find it at all plz help me I will forever be in your debt.",anime
"Space Pirate Captain Harlock: I liked it so much, I stopped watching it because I didn't want it to end. That Anime reminded me of why I got big into anime 20 years ago and there's nothing new that's Leiji Matsumoto inspired. I mean there's remakes and there's Ozuma, but that's it.",anime
You can't go wrong with parasyte. It's the safest anime I recommend because it's really hard to hate. The story isn't as intricate/long as aot but I enjoy it more because the characters are definitely much more likeable and overall better. Uhhh this is the main one and I'm guessing ur into action mystery sort if shows so I guess if I had to pick something else I would go with black lagoon.,anime

"[Comment from episode 5 discussion that links to other blog posts and analyzes the flower language used in the show](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/lg59f5/wonder_egg_priority_episode_5_discussion/gmph2v6/).

Personally, I see it as an analysis of the traumas that youth (and adults too) face in Japanese society.

[My interpretation of character themes](/s ""Ai faces alienation because of her heterochromia in a society that favors group harmony over individualism. Rika's world is a representation of the cult-like fanaticism of idol culture [fans following their idol in death]. Momoe faces Japan's relative intolerance [compared to the West] of non-traditional gender roles. And Neiru seems to face the  fetishization of youth [especially for women]."")",anime
"**Rewatcher**

Another Midori episode, and this time it is about her getting overwhelmed and taking on too many responsibilities as the Captain.

Kisaragi-senpai comes to check up on the crew! She eats Pocky like a chipmunk, but so do I honestly lol

And Mochizou took pictures of last year's performance, but we see they are all of Tamako. I'm sure that's just because its her family's scrap book and no other reason. Then she asks him to take photos again ""Of course I will.... of you"" What was that Mochi???

But Midori quickly becomes overwhelmed and I'm sure we have all been in her position during school. Oh I have a paper to write? Let's spend hours aimlessly doing nothing because I have no idea how to do the introduction paragraph. 

Kanna realizes she is in over her head and begins plotting her mutiny. Then mirroring the Shiori episode, Midori tries to encourage herself in the bathroom mirror before Shiori walks in and later informs the other girls. 

When they go to visit Midori, Kanna notices the trash. Her carpenters eye makes her very observant as we have seen before. Her and Dera are really good at noticing things about peoples emotions.

Finally, Choi-chan... She brought up the bride again while making the costumes and smells Tamako again... But the flower Dera liked at the start of the show was shown in focus multiple times before and after she smelled Tamako. Hmmm. And then Choi notices the birthmark on Tamako's neck on festival day. And uh oh, who would have guessed that Tamako is the bride!

"Man this whole situation sucks. After everything she went through Rika certainly deserves this if it's what she wants, but damn it's so unfair for Satoko after everything *she's* been through. Satoko doesn't know Satoshi is alive, she's isolated from Keiichi and Rena, Shion has graduated I presume(although I don't think they were particularly close in the Miracle Route anyway), and I'd probably shoot a guess that they have hardly spoken to Mion at all since she left. I won't necessarily say Rika should have learned by now that chances are you can't have your cake and eat it too, but she should have known Satoko would have never fit in such a place. 

Let's also not forget that Rika and Satoko getting along in the first place could be argued to only be by chance of Rika looping over and over and eventually just forcing it to work. They are extremely different people, Rika was always going to leave Satoko behind and join the popular crowd. Because that's what she imagines to be a future she fought for. Rika perceives a proper, ladylike life to be what is meant for her, which I personally would say comes from a distortion of her personal reality from spending so much time there.

I don't know. Rika shouldn't have pushed Satoko to follow her, and instead reinforced their friendship while they had the time so it could remain through separation during high school. On the other hand, by the entrance exam Satoko seemed to have already known she wouldn't fit. When the idea of not getting in to St. Lucia popped into her head she didn't immediately ask if Rika would give up her dream for her, but instead acknowledging that Rika would have to go on alone. She should have just followed Keiichi and Rena to a normal school.

Next episode gonna be tragic. I'm gonna take a stab and say she'll reach L5, kill Rika's snobby friends, and then some otherworldly presence will step in before she can claw her own throat out. I need S2 to be announced like immediately tbh, I'm actually kind of stressing out about how rushed this would likely feel if it were totally solved by episode 24.",anime

"###Rewatcher

First timers! If you made it this far, congratulations for sticking with us. Now Sunshine bares its true nature.

2 episodes ago I asked: ""What do you think of [Yume de Yozora o Terashitai], the choreography and the PV? If we take out the flying lanterns and the gorgeous background, would it still be considered appealing?""

Aqours performing the simplistic and less polished ""Yume de Yozora o Terashitai"" right after Saint Snow's more interesting and very polished ""SELF CONTROL!!"" would just make the audience forget about it.

Hence, it's no wonder why Aqours lost on their first ever competition. They quickly realize it too when they saw Saint Snow perform. Saint Snow might be a top tier school idol group, but even they didn't win. Saint Snow is not at the top of the mountain; they are the baseline of any school idol group striving to win Love Live like our little rural group. But Aqours is very very very far behind such school idol groups. They know it and it hurts.

To rub it in further, Aqours placed 30th out of 30... with 0 votes. Ouch... Aqours might be the most popular school idol group in Numazu, but here in Tokyo, they're not even worth anything.

Saint Snow tells them the grim reality of school idols in the present time, a far different view from the school idols during µ's era.

The ride home isn't much better especially when Chika, more aware than ever that she's their leader, continues to say hollow words of encouragement.

Dia welcomes them back at Numazu Station and finally shows that she cares, always had been, as she discusses about what happened. About how Aqours' performance is not a failure, it's just that there's a lot more people into school idols now and with it, a lot more people taking it seriously. About how they could at least sing on stage with that kind of pressure, unlike *their* school idol group two years ago.

Dia tells Aqours that she, Kanan and Mari were a school idol group two years ago, was invited to the same competition, failed to sing and gave up. And as we see in the present day, the incident left the three of them broken: Dia does her best not to make history repeat again, Kanan wants nothing to do with school idols, and Mari tries to repair her old friendships.

Chika is left pondering over everything and while she does arrive on an admirable answer, it's still very frustrating. That's why Chika breaks down; everyone would. There's nothing more frustrating than putting in effort to something you love, finding out the large gap in skill between you and your opponent/s, and losing in a fair competition. It's demoralizing at times...

And for anyone still thinking Chika is Honoka 2.0, this episode highlights the major difference between Honoka and Chika:

Honoka is the type of person who, after falling down, gets up and runs as if nothing happened (well, most of the time). Because of this, µ's depends on her to pull them from their anxieties. 

Chika is not that type of person. Chika is the type ",anime

"The sub's theory that the Kumoko cave sequences are in the past looks more and more believable. I think that the Nightmare Vestige is our Kumoko in the ""present"", except that it's not exactly our Kumoko. It's design (all white with pink accents and spikes on the abdomen) is extremely similar to Kumoko plus it is extremely fast, dodges a lot, and has some sort of poison attack. But it's not the Kumuko ""proper"", it's probably a clone that either rebelled or she left behind to guard the labyrinth. She gains Parallel Minds this episode, and I assume she gets 2 more ""minds"" when it levels up and another skill that can form clones since we see 3 other Kumoko's in the ED with her. Julius also calls it the Nightmare VESTIGE and says it was left there by the Nightmare of the Labyrinth.  I'm thinking by this time Kumoko has left the Labyrinth and her grinding in a Dark Souls dungeon makes her a nightmare when compared to the regular folk outside.",anime

There is relatability, even if a character does something which is reprehensible. But at the same time neither series has yet condoned these actions.

There are positive and negative consequences for both, even for Mushoku Tensei which is in its early days of airing. Paul's infidelity nearly destroyed the household and Rudeus nearly lost his first friend. Maybe the story will go awry in its message, but it's rude to interrupt people when they are talking. Current criticism is akin to taking a quote out of context, or a snapshot of a person looking their worst. It is too early to tell.

Now in regards to China's censorship specifically. It is yet another indicator of extremism, where outside views are not tolerated at all. I'd say thankfully it hasn't gotten to the point where people are getting killed over it, but A Certain Chief Executive Officer has been missing for a while now.",anime
"I have a hard time disliking anime for a few reasons:

1. There's not really bad acting. There's bad directing and bad production, but studios usually do a good job making anime.
2. Hating a certain VA can easily be changed via changing sub to dub, vice versa
3. The really bad animations are just the ones where there's no effort put into it / lack of experienced members on the team (the recent Ex-Arm being one).
4. Narratives are one part. A shonen with a generic story but with great visual and great music can easily make me overlook the story. If the story is extremely god awful with nothing else going for it, I'm talking Pupa or Mars Of Destruction Levels, I'd drop the show.
5. The workers. They get paid terribly; yet create such beautiful pieces. We see the studio name get credit. The mangaka who made the story get credit. But the nameless animators and workers will usually just be nameless.

Number 5 is the biggest reason why I refuse to hate the anime I watch. It's such a collective effort to create a single anime; why shit on it; popular or unpopular?",anime

"Overall yes.

The first episode is a bit overdone, and the show drives home how evil the goblins are pretty regularly and often in similar ways, although rarely as graphically as the first time.

So if your particularly squeamish or averse to that kind of material for w/e reason the show probably isn't for you.

Then they choose an american-looking chick (in a PLAYBOY BUNNY OUTFIT) flying on a sword (bushido) reminiscent of the silver surfer....Cross-cultural messages.

"I recently completed watching Attack on Titan which I enjoyed watching so when I was looking for an anime something similar to Attack on Titan I came across Demon Slayer saw some posts on reddit people has some mixed opinions so Thought os giving it a try as it has only 26 episodes. Started with zero hype but I like it from the first episode itself. But as the show went on  I felt like the show was being rushed even though the story plot line has lot of potential (personal opinion). 

Top personal favorite scenes:   
episode 1 fight between Giyu Tomiok and Tanjiro Kamado where Tanjiro throws the axe first before attacking Tomiok(didn't expect that).  
and the episode where Tanjiro fights with rui (lower rank 5) and unleashed the fire dance,  but was disappointed to find out lrui wasn't killed and later Tomiok killed rui. I mean they showed that Tanjiro unleashing a great power and split rui's head and later we find that rui himself did that and it had nothing to do with Tanjiro

On a whole I have enjoyed the anime but felt the story had more potential. 

So where can I watch the movie that came out as continuation from the end of episode 26. I watched the anime on Crunchyroll but couldn't find the movie there.

Also please do suggest me some good anime something in this category. Something that is short may be less than 100 episodes.",anime

- /u/punching_spaghetti There was a good 15-18 seconds of stocking shots. I know they aren't the same stockings as we saw in Miru Tights, but it still counted for something right?

"Fun fact 1: Grass contains cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The first two are long chains of sugar molecules, the last one is different. Lignin is made of chains of 9 carbon molecules, but they are linked chaotically (compared to cellulose or hemicellulose). When making paper chemically, what is actually done is the hemicellulose and lignin are dissolved in sodium hydroxide. Industrially, sodium hydroxide alone is not enough, there is sodium sulfide added to help break down the lignin.  
  
Fun fact 2: The material Senku created is actually called ""[paper composite panel/ Richlite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_composite_panels)"", not carbon fiber (carbon fiber is different). It will be used in the future Tesla Cybertruck as its [dashboard](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-marble-dashboard-paper-material/).

"[New CDF!](#urarahype)

This week I decided to pick up Fire Emblem Three Houses again, so now I'm back to making progress on my Holy Knights-only meme run of Silver Snow. I'm on chapter 9 now and *just* got 2 Holy Knights by way of F!Byleth (who I named Nopht) and Yuri. Leonie's high enough level for it as well, but since Master Seals are super limited until chapter 16 I kinda want to save them for my in-house characters first. 

Once I'm done with that, I'm going to do a Golden Deer PMU and I'm *so* excited for that~ I'm sure it's gonna be even more of a meme run than this one, especially since I've set aside Lysithea as a War Cleric who is only allowed to fight with Gauntlets because [seiyuu](https://s1.zerochan.net/Tachibana.Hibiki.600.2163246.jpg) for this run. Been wanting to use her like that even before War Cleric was added to the game, but just didn't have the right time to do it because I was either playing with the English voices, didn't have Lysithea, and/or the run didn't lend itself to meme units very much.

You guys play any fun games recently?",anime

"This show has a real problem with characters stating the obvious. Case in point, when senku gets the idea for improving the Gorilla. What does the audience gain by having both Kohaku and Suika comment that he looks mischievous, when it's very obvious that's what the scene was trying to imply anyways. We've seen that look before, we know what it means. 

Like I understand this show errs on the younger demographic, but there's a difference between characters making observations and the writers thinking the audience is stupid.",anime
"**Rewatcher who's obsessed with SELF-CONTROL!!**

I'm mostly going to be talking about SELF-CONTROL!!, because I love that song. If you haven't yet, do yourself a favor and listen to [the full version](https://love-live.fandom.com/wiki/SELF_CONTROL!!)...the TV version cuts so many good parts, like Leah's main rap section.

I think I particularly like when Love Live songs do something different from usual. Aqours is great for this, since you've got things like the chuuni indulgence that is [Daydream Warrior](https://love-live.fandom.com/wiki/Daydream_Warrior), but I think nothing is quite as shockingly different as SELF-CONTROL!!. You get hopes and dreams songs all the time in Love Live, but rarely do you get one expressing anger and frustration, but also ambition and determination. It's not every day you get an idol song with lyrics like ""Crush your weakness everyday"" or ""Loneliness is something you aim for yourself / Now, I'll bet everything on it"". In a way, it's a very un-idol-like kind of song...a reaction to a cruel and unforgiving world, and a defiance of it.

SELF-CONTROL!! just does such a good job of summing up this episode...Saint Snow is much more used to the frustration of the current Love Live competition, and they've put their feelings into song, just like school idols are supposed to do, but their feelings aren't the kind of feelings that people like ?'s thought school idols would be feeling. It's a very raw statement of frustration, but also of overcoming it through pure determination.

I know that SELF-CONTROL!! is probably meant as a negative example, a bitter reaction to adversity to set up Saint Snow as a foil to Aqours, but it really speaks to me in a very visceral way. It's true...dreams aren't always easy to achieve, and in the end all you have to rely on is yourself and your own effort. The vision of something like Sunny Day Song just isn't always realistic. I think this is part of the reason Saint Snow took off in the LL fandom in a way A-RISE never did...they're just so damn relatable, and having the rivals face the same struggles as the main characters really makes them more human than the far-off, larger-than-life A-RISE.

**Discussion questions**

1. Aqours is still growing...they've got a lot to learn, and this's just part of the learning process.

2. I think it's a good step away from SIP. Sunshine always walked a thin line, trying to hew closely enough to SIP to please the part of the fandom that was stuck to ?'s while also differentiating themselves enough to please the people complaining that Aqours was just a ?'s close. I think having failure and hardship along the way in a way ?'s never did is not only an interesting approach, but a realistic one, presenting a more competitive and cruel school idol world that ?'s never foresaw.",anime

"Alright, in my opinion, Yue and Hajime's relationship is trash and Hajime only likes her because she was the first person he interacted with after he changed. (change my mind) 

Like don't get me wrong, I love Yue as a character and what she brings to the group... but I just find her lackluster personality completely wrong for him given all the other girls he has to chose from. 

Also, I feel she's the only girl that if the situation was reversed and she came to the group later, wouldn't fit  the dynamic. She only accepts the others because she knows Hajime is in love with her, but would she accept them if he loved one of the others first? I'm not so sure.

With that said, here are my rankings! 

Best for Hajime: 

1. Kaori 
2. Shizuku 
3. Shea
4. Yue 
5. Tio

My hottest list:

1. Tio
2. Kaori (pre change) 
3. Shea
4. Shizuku
5. Kaori (post change)
6. Yue

Honestly though I wish Hajime would just drop the monogamy crap... I'm not sure why he has that trait to begin with with all the personality changes he's gone though ???????",anime

" Any chance we are going to see Ushiromiya Ange here? 

Really good episode, 

Rika's downfall will be cause by her own hubris, forgetting the fact that she has hundreds of years of experience more than Satoko, and that she is neglecting her oldest and closest friend, that only came to this school to be with her. 

Satoko had a chance to be close to Rika, if she had just been humble and accepted Rika's Help, she may even have befriended Rika's new friends, but her pride got in the way, and now she is in a downward spiral. 

I expect Featherine or Lambdadelta to show up in the next episode when Satoko is at her wits end, to give her the power of magic, to return to the summer of 1983, so she can be with Rika and shape the future so they never get Separated. 

As we get more information Satoko=Lambda seems even more plausible, especially since Takano has gotten close to no screen time, and her arc has already been resolved in the most recent Timeline",anime
"It was worth my time, it probably takes an opposite approach to HxH in that effectively everything was planned out in advance, but both shows have a lot of similarities as well (e.g. Gon is looking for Ging in the beginning of HxH, Luffy is looking for the pirate that inspired him, Shanks, towards the beginning of One Piece as a sort of mid-term goal, both series have excellent power systems and exploration, etc.) Usually I copy-and-paste or otherwise paraphrase some variation of [my advice from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/jaranp/need_help_with_new_animes/g8raw3c) whenever pitching One Piece but basically give it 30-90 episodes if you decide to try it, and make an educated guess on if the rest is worth your time based off that (although it doesn't reach its full stride until around episode 200 or 230.)

**I seriously would not recommend skipping any of the ""filler""/anime-original stuff** (I talked about each of those arcs [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/j8ac6z/comment/g8t7ahn) in a spoiler-free way except for the first filler arc, the Warship Island arc, which I would also recommend), really **they only make up like 10% of One Piece's total length anyways.** Honestly these are, effectively, all well-implemented and give the story and its characters a chance to breathe, plus the series goes through some pains to incorporate the characters/events/etc. from the filler arcs into other places of the One Piece anime on multiple occasions.


Roughly the episodes between 100 and 200 are kind of a trudge so if you needed to, the manga or the One Pace fancuts could be preferable for those arcs (Alabasta and Skypiea)... although I just watched it all dubbed, personally. Certain arcs (like Enies Lobby) will pad things out ridiculously with footage and events you saw from the previous episode; so there's whole chunks of the anime where you'll skip the first 7-8 minutes per episode which makes things go by faster. Also you could probably watch the series on 1.25 speed if you really wanted to. Around the 500th episode is an excellent place to stop/pause, which makes the length of One Piece more comparable to something like Naruto, personally I've stopped/paused at episode 540 still.

Hope that helps! Feel free to comment/tag/DM if you have any other thoughts or questions, if you end up checking the series out I'd be a little curious to hear how it goes (but no obligation of course), take care",anime

Honorary OST of the day: [PRIDE AND JOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37kXVmo3CUU) (Kana's dream)

---

Hey look, its what happens when you pull out the hair of a parasite. I bet there's some way to start correlating murders around people using the hair pulling, but I know a lot more about computers than i do criminal justice, so i doubt i could make any idea of it feasible, though it looks like they're going to try it anyways.

We have finally gone back to Kana, this time starting out in a dream, being attacked by what are essentially monsters. One has to wonder, could these dreams be connected to her power, seeing as how Shinichi is the one who saves her? She's also somehow aware of Shinichi's arm in the dream. There's also this [weird ass horse face.](https://i.imgur.com/Ndh2rvP.png) Shinchi gives another warning to stop using the power, yet she does nothing to listen. We also get an actual conversation between Kana and Murano, though you can read into that as you like. 

We also have to assume that its been some time between the hair fad starting and people connecting the dots to the parasites, since Kana is basically going ""yeah the hair will tell me which one is a monster"". This is bolstered by the reaction of the girl who was killed at the beginning of the episode, but they do a terrible job of actually showing how much information has spread. Cant wait to read the complaints about this. 


We also finally get to see a parasite be relevant for longer than 30 seconds that isint just killing for food, absolutely destroying a Yakuza gang hideout, complete with a kickass OST track (that technically showed up last episode but I like it better here). Those who cased after him are absolute idiots, not so much for running after him, but totally skipping out on calling the cops. Who does that? More importantly, it insinuates that the parasites are doing a lot more than we're privy to behind the scenes, seeing as how this was merely a ""test of power"" to take on an armed hideout, and the infiltrators even have their own power structure.

Shinichi *[no,](https://i.imgur.com/23jNzfF.png)* that is not how you deal with that.

Murano starts to connect the dots on Izumi's change. Info about his mother still isn't public either, so this probably hurts Shinichi a lot more than Murano would realize, and bites her in the ass as he abruptly leaves. Another instance of this shows up the very next scene as he has a reaction to the altercation between the random child and mother, before being able to bring him right back to his normal self, feeling like there's a ""hole"" in his heart. Kana gets a hole in [her own heart](https://i.imgur.com/PbyEI5F.jpg), still ignoring Shnichi's warnings and seeing he and Murano kiss.

Hey look, the parasites are trying t",anime
"**First Timer**  

Is it finally here? Could it be? Could this be the moment, where this becomes its own original story? Well I'll believe it when it keeps this up for some time....

Someone hinted at it, and yes the performance of ~~the duo whose name I forgot~~ Saint Snow  was really extremely different from the a capella version at the shrine.
  
And after today's episode, they feel a lot less like jerks, and a lot more like ambitious people, that wanted to show some rookies, how the real world is (well one half of them, the other half seems to take everything too serious, and doesn't get that not everyone has to be perfect)  

You know everything that can be done competitively, and gets popular, has this tendency to go too a point, where it just doesn't look fun anymore...  
Of course there are always people, that just have fun, and don't care if they are the best (like a hobby should imho be), but there are also those, that do it, to an extent, where it looks like it stops being a hobby. But at that point, where is the fun?  

I can totally get people trying to be better and better, but the opponent with whom you should compare you, is yourself, not others.  
It shouldn't matter if there are people better than you, as long as you are better than you were the last time.

But well, this episode wasn't about this, but about the not so fun experience, to learn that there are many people that are better than you...  
A experience everyone makes at some point.  
Ok 0 votes are quite a shocking way to make this experience.  
And being so shocked, that you can't perform even more.  

But it would be sad, to stop something you like just because of this.


But I'm a bit sad, how the whole culture around Love Live has changed, since the end of the movie.  
The movie had this nice feeling of ""It doesn't matter if you suck at it, just have fun"". On the other hand, that was pretty much what the nicer half of ~~the rival band  (I have to look up those names some time...)~~ Saint Snow said.


So to the questions of today:

1. Well it depends. I think the most important thing is to keep it fun, winning is secondary. But now that they know what is expected of them, when they want to win, they can be realistic about it, and improve in this direction. So they will have to train harder. (And yes I ignored the save the school part, because ~~it doesn't make sense~~ they don't need to be the best for this, they just need to become popular enough)
2. This was a nice twist. And I think from now on this could become some story of itself.

Oh and a last thought not fitting anywhere:  
So now we know that Mari just wants to get back to the fun times. Interesting.
Especially how she feels like a totally different person during that scene.

edit:
Forgot something (I probably should be less sleepy when writing stuff, maybe then I can focus on some themes instead of rambling...)

Is it only me, or did the ending lyrics feel quite fitting this episode?",anime
"So much happened that episode and I loved every bit of it.

Miku is still overwhelmingly best girl. She's so precious and I love how she ""declared war"" to try and win over Futaro. This girl is cute, kind, and knows exactly what she wants. 

I was starting to like Nino second most but she made Miku cry and that's heresy. And then Ichika ruining Miku's confession moment kind of upset me ngl. I guess that means the war is on.",anime
"I didn't expect this series to actually educate its viewers on the dangers of winter camping by putting its cast in a pretty risky situation.

(And while we don't know him, I'd guess he's not the type of person who'd do that anyway, I mean if he doesn't even care about himself...)

[Not enough white blood cells?](https://imgur.com/xvNjJpr) Is it because they all died, or because they're not being produced anymore? I'm not sure which one would be the most terrifying, but whichever it is, I'm sure it's gonna be this one!

Next episode is about athlete's foot, but I doubt this can lead to something like that (unless the treatment can have that effect?)

I looked up what caused the body to have less white blood cells, and there were a lot of things, including the infamous cancer...

The way Cancer was in the other Hataraku in the previous season, I can't imagine what it'd be like in this mess of a body that struggles to even stay alive!",anime

NK and Kil-sorry Memory T-Cell were hilarious! Loved how WBC and OC were trying to hide the last bacteria from those two but they knew haha!  That ano ne and ne was literally super cute and made me feel so happy since I just finished watching the latest Cells at Work Black ep (flipping blood clots :( ) Can't wait for the final two episodes! <3,anime

"Bleach is arguably one of the worst shit I’ve ever seen, like it’s utter garbage in my opinion, the SS arc is not even THAT good, it’s barely watchable, and that’s supposed to be the best part? Good luck with that, there are so many characters poorly written and with shitty/non existent characterization, the world setting is meh, like Edo Japan can be really cool (ex. Wano) but with Bleach is dry as hell, and don’t even get me started with the repetitive ’damsel in distress trope’, that’s all the plot, and Ichigo being over powered af, and they animated like 2 fights in 300+ episodes",anime

"Aoi asks Tomozaki to be Mimimi's campaign manager, she asks him for more difficult things to do each time. Being a campaign manager isn't something easy to do.
Tomozaki asks Mimimi to let him be her campaign manager but she refutes him because according to her he is a tad unreliable. Well at least he won't have to worry about it.

Kikuchi and Tomozaki's conversation was nice to see, Kikuchi feels like she can confide in him to tell him her thoughts and sentiments, like how she wants to change too. Tomozaki though saying that she's adorable was cool.

Hinami and Mimimi's campaigns are picking up pace, Misuzawa is Hinami's campaign manager and they are able to enchant the students to vote for them, Mimimi got her own manager too and she presents it to Tomozaki. Afterwards Tomozaki still finds a way to convince Mimimi to let him help her by being a brain, and i loved Mimimi's reaction to the word, she is so adorable and cute.

Tomozaki actually wants to take on Aoi Hinami, who he considers one of the most difficult bosses in the game of life. That'd be interesting to see.",anime

"*E29: Steam Gorilla*

*1.* *The Automobile*

* With the invention of the steam engine, Senku and his allies are very close to building an automobile, the ""Steam Gorilla""
* Chrome is thrown into prison, Tsukasa might have some reason of putting him into that location
* LOL Gen has a driver's license who knew it would come into play. Even in the stone world it's good to follow arbitrary traffic rules.
* Senku has too much pride to admit that part of why he built the automobile was to transport the elderly, but they're all allied with him and are 100% sure the Empire will be defeated 
* The automobile can't go up inclines since it was a rushed project with time constraints, so it obviously isn't as efficient as it could've been. Senku decides a power upgrade is absolutely necessary

*2. Scouting out Tsukasa's Empire*

* The Empire is fortified and heavily defended. Senku and his allies have set up a base camp next to the Empire
* They manage to find Chrome's bamboo prison with the help of Meitantei Suika
* Just as they think charging headon into the Empire would be disastrous, Senku suggests an overhaul to the automobile, to create a tank. The bamboo prison wouldn't be able to bear the impact of the tank. Additionally, the issue of efficiency is also alleviated since Senku would have succeeded in making a tracked vehicle capable of scaling inclines

*3. The Tank*

* A paper... tank? Well not quite, Senku plans to reinforce the automobile with shields
* Carbon fibre completely crushes Kinro's spear, and we see a reinforced steam gorilla
* Chrome's prison is strategically located near a bunch of traps. Tsukasa has already foresaw a steam car being built (it's easy to forget how much of a brute Tsukasa is that he's also incredibly smart, basically on par with Chrome)
* Right Kohaku... Scientist Chrome has to escape the prison by himself before Senku's ambush is used against them

"I've noticed anime is too fast paced these days and the few times they make anime in my favorite genre, (Sci-Fi) it's an overstimulating psychological thriller and I'm not a fan of that kind of climaxes. You know the kind of tension you get in competition shows where they're always fucking up and they're working on the thing until the clock hits zero or the kind of tension the fairly oddparents had with the cat & mouse games.


I hate that kind of tension because I get too much of that in my life and I don't want it in my escapism.


My advice to you is to try watching an anime you're 90% sure you won't like. I was 90% sure I wouldn't like this because it looks very simplistic and low budget. My sub-concise exceptions for anime to to be good goes away the older an anime looks.

"Emma has a future in mind of her and Noir running a shop together, probably in the most romantic way possible, but of course the rest of the Harem want in. And then Noir just bows out of the Harem's little spat because he knows there's no winning that one.

I was kind of feeling bad for Noir's dad until they reveal that he apparently gambles away most of their money. No wonder no one in his family seems to respect him to the point where not even his own daughter trusts him with their finances.

I'm betting Olivia wouldn't have minded if he felt her up a little more than that.

So Noir gains dungeon fast-travel, the ability to blind enemies, night-vision, and even cures a zombie! Not too shabby for one dungeon crawl. 

Who would have expected in this Harem adventure show we'd get such a heartfelt story between an elf and his best friend, a lion named Tigerson with a tulip on his head? Noir reuniting them and their subsequent parting was a sight to see, and in the end Noir did not only a good deed today but gained a loyal new friend in Tigerson, giving Tigerson a new friend to make up for parting from Vashelle.

I hope Vashelle's love really did wait for him in those 300 years...especially if going back to her was worth leaving Tigerson.

I love how the dad is freaking out but Noir's mom and Alice are so non-plussed by Tigerson. They're just cool with whatever Noir does at this point. 

So Tigerson's tulip is...definitely a sensitive area. And considering Noir's dad compared it to something he does with his wife, and Tigerson got all hot and bothered by Alice rubbing it, doesn't take too much to guess what it's supposed to represent.

Alice sure takes care of her big brother...and has some lewd thoughts about his earwax.

"This guy will need a liver transfer if this keeps up. And that’s not the only health problem this man is dealing with. It’s thanks to people like the main red blood cell and white blood cell that this body keeps making it but one day this bodies luck will fortunately run out.

I just started watching the anime Tonikawa and really enjoyed it. However every episode from ep 3 required some sort of subscription; like on Crunchyroll. It's a really cute anime and I really want to watch the rest.,anime
"> And while asking, may as well ask what some more normal magical girl animes are worth checking out? 

Not that dark but Symphogear and Nanoha are great magica girls show with some mecha trope added to it.

Symphogear has the bonus gimmick that the girls are singing while fighting and it's awesome.",anime
