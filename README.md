1) First, upload the train.csv and test.csv files which will be used for the training and testing pupose of various algorithms.

2) At the start, code of the pre-processing of the data and the divison of the data according to the class it belongs to is present, which can be run for future requirements.

3) Class of Bernoulli Naive Bayes which is developed from scratch and can be used for the k-fold, and for the training set accuracy calculation.

4) Various Sci-Kit learn Algorithms are implemented, it will generate the accuracy of the test set which has been divided using the train_test_split of Sci-Kit Learn.

5) Various Feature Construction methods are implemented such as Bit Vectorizer, Term Frequency Vectorizer, and TF-IDF; and can be used for experiment purpose.

6) K-fold of all the Sci-Kit Models are performed using the KFold of Sklearn.
