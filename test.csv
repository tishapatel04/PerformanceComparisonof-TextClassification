0,"I think we need to be proactive in detecting misinformation and questioning our strongly held beliefs. 

The political and profit motive to manipulate people and sway opinion is immense and the technology is a growth industry.

So, we need to train kids and adults on how to be ""misinformation resistant."" And, that doesn't just mean ""learn from X and Y approved sources."" The problem of the future may well be a situation where we cannot tell what is ""fake"" or ""true."" Examine our own biases, and realize that someone agreeing with us can be more deceptive than someone disagreeing.

The only remedy is critical thinking skills and not investing too much in ""knowing the truth"" or being outraged at those that don't know your ""truth"". Case in point; ""Study says that X people are stupid, don't listen and driven to violence, and you can discount what they have to say."" Regardless on whether the study is true or not - it asks you to ""ignore what people have to say."" It's telling you NOT TO LISTEN. Regardless of merit, it isn't productive. 

What action do I take with this new information? Do I feel superior? Do I react differently to X people? The question is; why don't I see a study on; ""How to find common ground and get along with X people""? Find out what is the product. What is being sold to you if you ""buy this"" idea or fact? 

Another strategy that is useful is of course science itself. An experimental proof is supposed to be reproducible. Kids could be given more open-ended problems in a science class and taught skills on how to reproduce experiments rather than just memorize the facts of them. If someone gives you information that is suspect -- then ask for sources. Then find the sources of those sources. If you cannot get from A to B based on their source material, then you might have misinformation.

But, I recognize we don't have the time and energy to test everything. So, perhaps sample testing our sources of information on occasion to verify they are good is in order. A source that sometimes gives us misinformation is then not a good source for information even if it is mostly correct."

4,"# Abstract

Rootless plants in the genus *Wolffia* are some of the fastest growing known plants on Earth. *Wolffia* have a reduced body plan, primarily multiplying through a budding type of asexual reproduction. Here, we generated draft reference genomes for *Wolffia australiana* (Benth.) Hartog & Plas, which has the smallest genome size in the genus at 357 Mb and has a reduced set of predicted protein-coding genes at about 15,000. Comparison between multiple high-quality draft genome sequences from *W. australiana* clones confirmed loss of several hundred genes that are highly conserved among flowering plants, including genes involved in root developmental and light signaling pathways. *Wolffia* has also lost most of the conserved nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes that are known to be involved in innate immunity, as well as those involved in terpene biosynthesis, while having a significant overrepresentation of genes in the sphingolipid pathways that may signify an alternative defense system. Diurnal expression analysis revealed that only 13% of *Wolffia* genes are expressed in a time-of-day (TOD) fashion, which is less than the typical ?40% found in several model plants under the same condition. In contrast to the model plants *Arabidopsis* and rice, many of the pathways associated with multicellular and developmental processes are not under TOD control in *W. australiana*, where genes that cycle the conditions tested predominantly have carbon processing and chloroplast-related functions. The *Wolffia* genome and TOD expression data set thus provide insight into the interplay between a streamlined plant body plan and optimized growth."

6,"This is a very interesting paper as it shows results within one city and its surroundings.
They point out a possible link between exposure to air pollution and incidence of Parkinson's.

That got my attention because
- Air pollution reduces the amount of Vitamin D that your body produces (probably as it blocks the sun's rays). 
""Air pollutants can absorb UVB radiation and therefore possibly reduce the cutaneous syntheses of vitamin D""

7,"I think a significant amount of people here are misunderstanding the study. It does not show that they lie about their privileged upbringing, but their 'origin stories' extend beyond their own life, spanning multiple generations.

> We find that the main source of such misidentification is elaborate ‘origin stories’ that these interviewees tell when asked about their class backgrounds. **These accounts tend to downplay important aspects of their own, privileged, upbringings and instead emphasise affinities to working-class extended family histories.**
> 
> Our findings indicate that this misidentification is rooted in a self-understanding built on particular ‘origin stories’ which act to downplay interviewees’ own, fairly privileged, upbringings and **instead forge affinities to working-class extended family histories**. Yet while this ‘intergenerational self’ partially reflects the lived experience of multigenerational upward mobility, it also acts – we argue – as a means of deflecting and obscuring class privilege

So their origin story goes back to their parent's working class upbringings, and that is how they see their construct their own origin story. ""My grandparents were working class farmers, but with grit we have overcome these limitations and made success for ourselves"" is the way they frame it, not ""When I was born my family was privileged""."

9,"A new study from USC Australia has found that oral doses of ketamine administered in a clinical setting can provide a rapid-acting treatment for chronic suicidality.

The study from USC’s Thompson Institute, published in Translational Psychiatry, showed that within the first six weeks, 69 percent of participants achieved a clinical reduction in suicide ideation.

Principal investigator psychiatrist Dr Adem Can, who led the research at USC, said the findings were significant, given the difficulty of treating chronic suicidality, and had the potential to save lives.

“On average, patients experienced a significant reduction in suicide ideation, from a high level before the trial to below the clinical threshold by week six of the trial,” Dr Can said.

“In medicine, this response rate is significant, particularly given it was experienced by patients with chronic suicidality, which can be difficult to treat.

“These patients had lived with suicidality for a very long time and presented a range of psychiatric conditions, including mood, anxiety and personality disorders, and many of them had lost hope of recovery.”

Three factors influence the sea level changes locally:

• Temperatures – Hot water is more voluminous than cold water, hence sea level may rise more in the Tropics.

• Winds – The dominant winds in a region affect the shape of the seas.

• Oceanic currents – Global warming can cause changes in oceanic currents, which would have a direct impact on local sea-level rise.

The coastlines’ shape and the tectonic settings can also affect the response of a given location to sea-level change."

>**Question**  Are youths involved in the juvenile justice system who use, have access to, or have been injured by a firearm or threatened with a weapon during adolescence more likely to perpetrate firearm violence and own firearms in adulthood?

>**Findings**  This cohort study of 1829 randomly selected youth newly detained in a temporary juvenile detention center found that 85% of males and 63% of females were involved with firearms as adolescents. Nearly all types of firearm involvement during adolescence were associated with increased odds of using and owning firearms during adulthood.

>**Meaning**  These findings suggest that firearm use, access, injury, and being threatened with a weapon during adolescence may be risk factors for firearm perpetration and ownership in adulthood.

Then, just a couple inches lower in the Abstract section:

>**Results**  Among the 1829 participants, 1388 had a 16-year follow-up interview: 860 males, 528 females; 809 were African American, 203 were non-Hispanic White; 374 were Hispanic; and 2 were other race/ethnicity; median (interquartile range) age of 32 (30-32) years. Eighty-five percent of males and 63.2% of females were involved with firearms as adolescents. Compared with females, males had significantly higher odds of every type of involvement except having a firearm in the home. In adulthood, 41.3% of males and 10.5% of females perpetrated firearm violence. Adolescents who had been threatened with a weapon or injured by firearms had 3.1 (95% CI, 2.0-4.9) and 2.4 (95% CI, 1.2-4.9) times the odds of perpetrating violence during adulthood. Similar associations were found for firearm ownership.

29,"Using patient data, artificial intelligence can make a 90 percent accurate assessment of whether a person will die from COVID-19 or not, according to new research at the University of Copenhagen. Body mass index (BMI), gender and high blood pressure are among the most heavily weighted factors. The research can be used to predict the number of patients in hospitals, who will need a respirator and determine who ought to be first in line for a vaccination.

Artificial intelligence is able to predict who is most likely to die from the coronavirus. In doing so, it can also help decide who should be at the front of the line for the precious vaccines now being administered across Denmark.

The result is from a newly published study by researchers at the University of Copenhagen's Department of Computer Science. Since the COVID pandemic's first wave, researchers have been working to develop computer models that can predict, based on disease history and health data, how badly people will be affected by COVID-19.

Based on patient data from the Capital Region of Denmark and Region Zealand, the results of the study demonstrate that artificial intelligence can, with up to 90 percent certainty, determine whether an uninfected person who is not yet infected will die of COVID-19 or not if they are unfortunate enough to become infected. Once admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, the computer can predict with 80 percent accuracy whether the person will need a respirator.

40,"I have read before that a couple of major factors in the advancement of humans beyond our earlier forms has two significant factors.       
         
One major factor in the development of our brain came from humans starting to cook their food. Cooking makes the food much easier to digest and we extract significantly more nutrients from it. This is believed to be associated with beneficial changes in or brain because we didn't need as much food and the increased nutrients basically gave our brains more fuels and 'tools.'           
            
The other major factor was farming.  Farming gave us a larger and steadier supply of food, increased the nutritional types of food and their nutritional value.  Farming also allowed us to settle down and establish more permanent communities as well as giving us more free time to devout to matters not necessary or not as necessary to survival.      
       
So two major events toward human development were cooked food (++nutrition) and farming (++nutrition, ++settlements, +free-time)  I imagine the first use of tools played a big part and related to that was the use of tools to make other/better tools.
           
I have read the minimum number for a self sustaining group of humans is between 60 and 180. Could we take a specific primates group number and after specifically selecting the starting primates based on genetics put them in a self contained habitat? Say something like the equivalent of the BioDome? Create some type of job/work for the primates to do to get food. Maybe design something game like meant to promote cooperation and higher levels of thinking. Do this in an attempt to do what farming did for us. Establish basic 'work' routines that the primates would do for a few hours every day.  Maybe a short morning and short evening shift of whatever length of time reasonable for them.  The work could be adapted and changed gradually according to their behaviors and to try and encourage beneficial changes and developments.  If they do the work they get food. If they do more work a little extra. If they figure out creative ways or better ways to do the work give them special food sort of like a treat to reward and encourage that. The food could be a carefully tailored diet and cooked as well.
Using birth control the primates could have whatever social and romantic relationships they want however use selective breeding to encourage ideal traits and posiible remove negative ones. Outside primate genetic material could be used as well to influence the expirement.        
         
Perhaps add some games with rewards to encourage creative thinking. Perhaps a task that requiers using a basic tool. Maybe provide the toll the first few times then swith it for the basic materials to try and get them to then build that tool. Occasional simplify the the starting level of materials to build the tool to make it more complex working toward them making a tool from bare resources nit just putting a couple pieces tog"

>Behavior is a way for organisms to respond flexibly to the environmental conditions they encounter. Our own species exhibits large behavioral flexibility and occurs in all terrestrial habitats, sharing these environments with many other species. It remains unclear to what extent a shared environment constrains behavior and whether these constraints apply similarly across species. Here, we show that foraging human populations and nonhuman mammal and bird species that live in a given environment exhibit high levels of similarity in their foraging, reproductive, and social behaviors. Our findings suggest that local conditions may select for similar behaviors in both humans and nonhuman animals.

81," **ABSTRACT**:

Sleep deprivation is highly prevalent and is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Age-related alterations in sleep and chronobiology may exaggerate CVD susceptibility in older individuals. The mechanisms responsible for the association between sleep deprivation and CVD are not fully understood, but endothelial dysfunction may play a central role. Our objective was to conduct a systematic literature review to evaluate the evidence on the effects of sleep deprivation on endothelial function (EF). This review adhered to the PRISMA guidelines and was pre-registered with PROSPERO (#CRD42020192485, 07/24/2020). We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library for articles published through May 1, 2020. Eligibility criteria included publication in English and use of well-established EF methodologies in adult humans. Two investigators independently performed the literature search, study selection, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, and qualitative data synthesis. Out of 3571 articles identified, 24 articles were included in the systematic review. Main findings include the following: (1) shorter sleep duration is associated with lower macrovascular EF; (2) not sleeping 7–9 h/night is linked with impaired microvascular EF; (3) sleep restriction impairs micro- and macrovascular EF; (4) acute total sleep deprivation impairs micro- and macrovascular EF but data on macrovascular EF are less consistent; and (5) shift work impairs macrovascular EF. In conclusion, sleep deprivation impairs EF, which may explain the link between insufficient sleep and CVD. Future investigations should fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to combat the adverse endothelial effects of sleep deprivation across the lifespan."

Now Cornell and National Park Service researchers have pinpointed and confirmed its location by using geophysical imaging techniques and ground-penetrating radar.

The Tlingit built what they called Shiskinoow – the “sapling fort” – on a peninsula in modern-day Sitka, Alaska, where the mouth of Kasda Heen (Indian River) meets Sitka Sound at the Sitka National Historical Park. The fort was the last physical barrier to fall before Russia’s six-decade occupation of Alaska, which ended when the United States purchased Alaska in 1867 for $7 million.

The research, “Geophysical Survey Locates an Elusive Tlingit Fort in Southeast Alaska,” was published Jan. 25 in the journal Antiquity, by authors Thomas Urban, research scientist in the College of Arts and Sciences; and Brinnen Carter of the National Park Service.

95," **The failings of** *per se* **limits to detect cannabis-induced driving impairment: Results from a simulated driving study** 

 **Abstract**

## Objective

Many jurisdictions use *per se* limits to define cannabis-impaired driving. Previous studies, however, suggest that THC concentrations in biological matrices do not reliably reflect cannabis dose and are poorly correlated with magnitude of driving impairment. Here, we first review a range of concerns associated with *per se* limits for THC. We then use data from a recent clinical trial to test the validity of a range of extant blood and oral fluid THC *per se* limits in predicting driving impairment during a simulated driving task.

## Methods

Simulated driving performance was assessed in 14 infrequent cannabis users at two timepoints (30?min and 3.5?h) under three different conditions, namely controlled vaporization of 125?mg (i) THC-dominant (11% THC; <1% CBD), (ii) THC/CBD equivalent (11% THC; 11% CBD), and (iii) placebo (<1% THC & CBD) cannabis. Plasma and oral fluid samples were collected before each driving assessment. We examined whether *per se* limits of 1.4 and 7?ng/mL THC in plasma (meant to approximate 1 and 5?ng/mL whole blood) and 2 and 5?ng/mL THC in oral fluid reliably predicted impairment (defined as an increase in standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) of >2?cm relative to placebo).

## Results

For all participants, plasma and oral fluid THC concentrations were over the *per se* limits used 30?min after vaporizing THC-dominant or THC/CBD equivalent cannabis. However, 46% of participants failed to meet SDLP criteria for driving impairment. At 3.5?h post-vaporization, 57% of participants showed impairment, despite having low concentrations of THC in both blood (median = 1.0?ng/mL) and oral fluid (median = 1.0?ng/mL). We highlight two individual cases illustrating how (i) impairment can be minimal in the presence of a positive THC result, and (ii) impairment can be profound in the presence of a negative THC result.

## Conclusions

There appears to be a poor and inconsistent relationship between magnitude of impairment and THC concentrations in biological samples, meaning that *per se* limits cannot reliably discriminate between impaired from unimpaired drivers. There is a pressing need to develop improved methods of detecting cannabis intoxication and impairment."

Specifically: I think what this paper addresses is the ""solar spiral of death"" that utilities have floated for a while. Utilities' greatest fear is that as more people switch to ""free"" energy, there are fewer ratepayers left to take on the costs of maintenance and overhead, causing even more of them to switch to solar.

Purpose
Studies have shown that disadvantaged neighborhoods are associated with higher levels of crime and delinquent behaviors. Existing explanations do not adequately address how individuals select neighborhood. Thus, the current study employed a genetically-informed design to test whether living in a disadvantaged neighborhood might be partly explained by individual characteristics, including self-control and cognitive ability.

>Method
A sibling subsample of N = 1573 Add Health siblings living away from their parents at Wave 4 was used in twin analyses to assess genetic and environmental effects on neighborhood disadvantage. To evaluate which individual-level variables might longitudinally predict neighborhood disadvantage, a sample of N = 12,405 individuals was used.

>Results
Findings provided evidence of significant heritability (32%) of neighborhood disadvantage. In addition, a significant negative effect by adolescent cognitive ability on neighborhood disadvantage 14 years later was observed (? = ?0.04, p = .002). Follow-up analyses showed a genetic effect on the association between cognitive ability and neighborhood disadvantage.

>Conclusions
Study findings indicate substantial heritability of neighborhood disadvantage, showing that individuals themselves might potentially contribute to a self-selection process that explains which neighborhoods they occupy as adults."

125,">Abstract
Since the professionalization of US?based forensic anthropology in the 1970s, ancestry estimation has been included as a standard part of the biological profile, because practitioners have assumed it necessary to achieve identifications in medicolegal contexts. Simultaneously, forensic anthropologists have not fully considered the racist context of the criminal justice system in the United States related to the treatment of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color; nor have we considered that ancestry estimation might actually hinder identification efforts because of entrenched racial biases. Despite ongoing criticisms from mainstream biological anthropology that ancestry estimation perpetuates race science, forensic anthropologists have continued the practice. Recent years have seen the prolific development of retooled typological approaches with 21st century statistical prowess to include methods for estimating ancestry from cranial morphoscopic traits, despite no evidence that these traits reflect microevolutionary processes or are suitable genetic proxies for population structure; and such approaches have failed to critically evaluate the societal consequences for perpetuating the biological race concept. Around the country, these methods are enculturated in every aspect of the discipline ranging from university classrooms, to the board?certification examination marking the culmination of training, to standard operating procedures adopted by forensic anthropology laboratories. Here, we use critical race theory to interrogate the approaches utilized to estimate ancestry to include a critique of the continued use of morphoscopic traits, and we assert that the practice of ancestry estimation contributes to white supremacy. Based on the lack of scientific support that these traits reflect evolutionary history, and the inability to disentangle skeletal?based ancestry estimates from supporting the biological validity of race, we urge all forensic anthropologists to abolish the practice of ancestry estimation."

129,"The key word here is ""mothers"". Note that it does not say ""women."" The huge career penalty for being a mother and being away on maternity leave and having perceived or actual ""lower reliability"" due to managing family needs is well-documented.

It is fundamentally unfair that a woman will have a harder time having both a career and kids than a man will, but there is some biological component to this problem that is hard to solve.  Even if men take equal paternity time, something that should be facilitated by public policy, they still will never physically have to carry the baby.  And ultimately, one spouse or the other will always have to sacrifice career in order to provide family stability.  As a matter of pragmatism, it's almost always going to be the person who makes less money.  In our culture, that's usually the woman.

**abstract**

Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (N=682), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 10,000 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by 25 to 30 min per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 min, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 h per day. Over the course of the pandemic from March to July 2020 the proportion of participants at risk for clinical depression ranges from 46% to 61%, up to a 90% increase in depression rates compared to the same population just prior to the pandemic. Our analyses suggest that disruption to physical activity is a leading risk factor for depression during the pandemic. However, restoration of those habits through a short-term intervention does not meaningfully improve mental well-being."

Abstract:  

Aim: To study the characteristics and outcome among cardiac arrest cases with COVID-19 and differences between the pre-pandemic and the pandemic period in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). ................................................................................................................................................................................................... Method and results: We included all patients reported to the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation from 1 January to 20 July 2020. We defined 16 March 2020 as the start of the pandemic. We assessed overall and 30-day mortality using Cox regression and logistic regression, respectively. We studied 1946 cases of OHCA and 1080 cases of IHCA during the entire period. During the pandemic, 88 (10.0%) of OHCAs and 72 (16.1%) of IHCAs had ongoing COVID-19. With regards to OHCA during the pandemic, the odds ratio for 30-day mortality in COVID-19- positive cases, compared with COVID-19-negative cases, was 3.40 \[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31–11.64\]; the corresponding hazard ratio was 1.45 (95% CI 1.13–1.85). Adjusted 30-day survival was 4.7% for patients with COVID-19, 9.8% for patients without COVID-19, and 7.6% in the pre-pandemic period. With regards to IHCA during the pandemic, the odds ratio for COVID-19-positive cases, compared with COVID-19-negative cases, was 2.27 (95% CI 1.27–4.24); the corresponding hazard ratio was 1.48 (95% CI 1.09–2.01). Adjusted 30-day survival was 23.1% in COVID-19-positive cases, 39.5% in patients without COVID-19, and 36.4% in the pre-pandemic period. ................................................................................................................................................................................................... Conclusion: During the pandemic phase, COVID-19 was involved in at least 10% of all OHCAs and 16% of IHCAs, and, among COVID-19 cases, 30-day mortality was increased 3.4-fold in OHCA and 2.3-fold in IHCA."

**Author:** Steven D Levitt

**Journal:** The Review of Economic Students (Jan 2021; Vol 88, Iss 1, pp 378-405)

**Abstract:** Little is known about whether people make good choices when facing important decisions. This article reports on a large-scale randomized field experiment in which research subjects having difficulty making a decision flipped a coin to help determine their choice. For important decisions (e.g. quitting a job or ending a relationship), individuals who are told by the coin toss to make a change are more likely to make a change, more satisfied with their decisions, and happier six months later than those whose coin toss instructed maintaining the status quo. This finding suggests that people may be excessively cautious when facing life-changing choices.

140,"Abstract

### Background

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), incorporating exposure and response prevention (ERP) is widely recognised as the psychological treatment of choice for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Uncertainty remains however about the magnitude of the effect of CBT with ERP and the impact of moderating factors in patients with OCD.

### Method

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed randomised-controlled trials of CBT with ERP in patients of all ages with OCD. The study was preregistered in PROSPERO (CRD42019122311). The primary outcome was end-of-trial OCD symptom scores. The moderating effects of patient-related and study-related factors including type of control intervention and risk of bias were examined. Additional exploratory analyses assessed the effects of treatment fidelity and impact of researcher allegiance.

### Results

Thirty-six studies were included, involving 2020 patients (537 children/adolescents and 1483 adults) with 1005 assigned to CBT with ERP and 1015 to control conditions. When compared against all control conditions, a large pooled effect size (ES) emerged in favour of CBT with ERP (*g?=*?0.74: 95% CI?=?0.51 to 0.97?k?=?36), which appeared to diminish with increasing age. While CBT with ERP was more effective than psychological placebo (*g*?=?1.13 95% CI 0.71 to 1.55, k?=?10), it was no more effective than other active forms of psychological therapy (*g*?=??0.05: 95% CI -0.27 to 0.16, k?=?8). Similarly, whereas CBT with ERP was significantly superior when compared to all forms of pharmacological treatment (*g*?=?0.36: 95% CI 0.7 to 0.64, k?=?7), the effect became marginal when compared with adequate dosages of pharmacotherapy for OCD (*g*?=?0.32: 95% CI -0.00 to 0.64, k?=?6).A minority of studies (k?=?8) were deemed to be at low risk of bias. Moreover, three quarters of studies (k?=?28) demonstrated suspected researcher allegiance and these studies reported a large ES (*g*?=?0.95: 95% CI 0.69 to 1.2), while those without suspected researcher allegiance (k?=?8) indicated that CBT with ERP was not efficacious (*g*?=?0.02: 95% CI -0.29 to 0.33).

### Conclusions

A large effect size was found for CBT with ERP in reducing the symptoms of OCD, but depends upon the choice of comparator control. This meta-analysis also highlights concerns about the methodological rigor and reporting of published studies of CBT with ERP in OCD. In particular, efficacy was strongly linked to researcher allegiance and this requires further future investigation."

145,"This is totally rubbish, someone with an axe to grind or a very narrow view wrote this. You can reach this conclusion if you only examine wholesale energy prices, or if you limit yourself to utilities that only have a low solar penetration. This research ignored the retail cost model, focusing on wholesale concepts. If you start looking at retail cases and high penetration, wholesale variables lower retail prices until you hit about 40% penetration - but then there's a dramatic increase in retail price as you keep packing in more.

Edit: and *retail* generators can only improve costs for neighbors if there's equitable time of use pricing - meaning, if you get paid very little for backfeeding during off-peak (or even charged!) - because retail generation increases operating overhead. And when rates are *equitable* retail rooftops become less valuable as more people install them. Again, you need the entire retail rate case, not a few main indicators from wholesale.

This paper focuses heavily on wholesale cost-model concepts and doesn't touch any concepts about operating overhead or retail cost model - for example, he talks about ""avoided O&M expenditures"" but fails to discuss capEX or new O&M expenses incurred due to high variability. There is actually a very substantial extra maintenance component for rotating generators that balloons out of control when utilization is low, so it's insincere to talk about ""avoided O&M expenditures"" unless you next talk about ""changes to O&M cost model assumptions"" or something like that.

I was in business operations in the solar industry. For the biggest solar company in the world. I handled all manner of contracts & retail use cases, large and small. From 700Mw+ wholesale to 400kw retail.

Getting to a purely battery/hydro/solar/wind portfolio capable of operating with no inertia will triple retail rates unless you accept a few blackouts a year, or wait another 20 years for additional I&C tech. The choices and possible solutions lie along those three dimensions: price, time for additional r&d, reliability.

To make claims like this you'd better back it up with an entire retail rate case. This paper cherry picks aspects that are favorable to their message."

These beliefs, along with experiences of personal and/or family connected economic difficulties, are associated with past arrests. These beliefs and experiences may be reflective of a resentment-fueled unrest and social volatility that characterize our present national moment.

Pervasive duplication of tumor suppressors in Afrotherians during the evolution of large bodies and reduced cancer risk

Abstract

The risk of developing cancer is correlated with body size and lifespan within species. Between species, however, there is no correlation between cancer and either body size or lifespan, indicating that large, long-lived species have evolved enhanced cancer protection mechanisms. Elephants and their relatives (Proboscideans) are a particularly interesting lineage for the exploration of mechanisms underlying the evolution of augmented cancer resistance because they evolved large bodies recently within a clade of smaller bodied species (Afrotherians). Here, we explore the contribution of gene duplication to body size and cancer risk in Afrotherians. Unexpectedly, we found that tumor suppressor duplication was pervasive in Afrotherian genomes, rather than restricted to Proboscideans. Proboscideans, however, have duplicates in unique pathways that may underlie some aspects of their remarkable anti-cancer cell biology. These data suggest that duplication of tumor suppressor genes facilitated the evolution of increased body size by compensating for decreasing intrinsic cancer risk."

Abstract: Emotional abuse is a form of intimate partner violence that can have detrimental effects on both individual well-being and relationship outcomes. However, differences in definitions and forms of emotional and psychological abuse have led to difficulties in its measurement. The Multi-Dimensional Measure of Emotional Abuse (MMEA) is an emotional abuse index that differentiates several different forms of psychological abuse. The current study sought to validate subscales of the MMEA by examining their relation to emotionally abusive behavior observed during interpersonal conflict. Additionally, the Conflict Tactics Scale Psychological Aggression scale and its severity subscales (CTS-PA) were compared to the MMEA. Heterosexual couples (*N* = 167) participated in a conflict discussion task. Conflict discussions were coded for belligerence, contempt, domineering, and stonewalling behavior. Women completed the MMEA and CTS-PA questionnaire about their own and their partners’ emotional abuse perpetration. Results indicated that the total MMEA score for men and women was associated with belligerence, whereas the CTS-PA total score was associated with women’s contempt. The restricted engulfment subscale was associated with men’s dominance and contempt, and woman’s belligerence. The minor CTS-PA scale was associated with men and women’s contempt, and women’s stonewalling. The severe CTS-PA scale was only associated with women’s contempt. Additionally, we found significant associations between men’s stonewalling and contempt and their partner’s MMEA and CTS-PA subscales. For women, stonewalling was associated with their partner’s restricted engulfment. Men’s hostile withdrawal scale was also associated with their partner’s dominance during the conflict. Our results suggest that the MMEA multi-dimensional subscales appear to capture a wider range specific abusive behaviors compared to the CTS-PA’s severity constructs."

205,"Closely adhering to a Mediterranean diet was associated with higher scores on a range of memory and thinking tests among adults in their late 70s, the research found.

The study found no link, however, between the Mediterranean-style diet and better brain health.

Markers of healthy brain ageing – such as greater grey or white matter volume, or fewer white matter lesions—did not differ between those regularly eating a Mediterranean diet and those who did not

Brain ageing
These latest findings suggest that this primarily plant-based diet may have benefits for cognitive functioning as we get older, researchers say.

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh tested the thinking skills of more than 500 people aged 79 and without dementia.

The participants completed tests of problem solving, thinking speed, memory, and word knowledge, as well as a questionnaire about their eating habits during the previous year.

MRI scanning
More than 350 of the group also underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan to gain insights into their brain structure.

The team used statistical models to look for associations between a person’s diet and their thinking skills and brain health in later life.

The findings show that, in general, people who most closely adhered to a Mediterranean diet had the highest cognitive function scores, even when accounting for childhood IQ, smoking, physical activity and health factors. The differences were small but statistically significant.

The individual components of the diet that appeared to be most strongly associated with better thinking skills were green leafy vegetables and a lower red meat intake.

Researchers say the latest findings add to the evidence that a healthier lifestyle, of which diet is one aspect, is associated with better thinking skills in later life.

But, perhaps, the welfare expansion increased the ability for people to intelligently assess welfare on a societal scale through things like increased education, increased interest in public policy, decreased stress, etc., and the increase in votes for the party with that welfare expansion policy was really support for the policy itself on those less self-interested grounds.

The team also found associations between sleep disturbance and sleep deficiency with overall risk of death. Results are published in Aging.

""Our findings illuminate a connection between sleep deficiency and risk of dementia and confirm the importance of efforts to help older individuals obtain sufficient sleep each night,"" said lead author, Rebecca Robbins, PhD, of the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders.

To investigate the connection between quality and quantity of sleep and risk of dementia and death, Robbins and colleagues used nationally representative data collected from older adults participating in the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). NHATS is a longitudinal study of Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older. Survey data from NHATS participants has been collected annually since 2011.

A sample of 2,610 participants answered sleep questionnaires in 2013 and 2014. The researchers examined participants' answers about several characteristics of sleep disturbance and deficiency, including alertness, nap frequency, how long it took participants to fall asleep, sleep quality (good/very good, fair, very poor/poor), sleep duration and snoring. They also collected information (from health care proxies as needed) about patient outcomes such as dementia and death from any cause for up to five years after the survey.

235,"Using Swedish forests for biofuel is a bad idea. The idea with biofuel is that all carbon released into the atmosphere is captured by the new plants when they grow, so over the whole cycle the net contribution to the atmosphere is zero. The problem with Swedish forests is that it grows slowly, so it takes 60-80 years for a tree to grow to logging size. That means that it takes 60-80 years to capture the carbon we released when we burned a tree as biofuel. In the meantime, that carbon will contribute to global warming as much as carbon coming from oil."

237,"I echo the concerns in here about how using ""forest residues"" would impact nutrient load in the forest floor following a logging event.  That's damned important and takes precedence over trying to be carbon neutral with alternative fueling strategies, in my mind.

So I wondered what potential could be found just with using sawdust from sawmills.  The first two paragraphs of the results/discussion section cover the contribution each source provides (note these are numbers based on what can be done in Sweden):

Forest residues offer up about 100 PJ of potential energy total each year.  About 35 PJ of that is already used, primarily in direct burning for direct heating or energy production.  The remaining 65 PJ is what seems to be on the table as an untapped resource.

Sawdust from sawmills, meanwhile, offers up about 35 PJ *total* in Sweden each year, but almost all of that is already used somehow--sawdust is very versatile, it turns out.  So using sawdust would likely require paying sawmills at least as much as they can already earn from selling off their sawdust.  The author estimates that bark could be used in the place of sawdust for many of its existent purposes, and so perhaps up to 25 PJ of energy from sawdust could in the future go toward biofuels, which is 38.4% of what forest residues could offer, and 27.8% of the total possible energy for biofuels that the paper surmises could be available per year in Sweden.

My take on it all: I think the author is understating the impact of redirecting forest residues and sawdust to biofuel production.  A lot of assumptions about business decisions are being made by somebody who wouldn't have to live with those decisions.  It's an intriguing idea, and maybe it could ultimately work out, but I think it's looking for ways to patch an existent system when really it needs to be overhauled wholesale."

Abstract

Gastrointestinal side effects (SEs) are frequently observed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) while taking antidepressants and may lead to treatment discontinuation. The aim of this meta-analysis is to provide quantitative measures on short-term rates of gastrointestinal SEs in MDD patients treated with second-generation antidepressants.

An electronic search of the literature was conducted by using MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science – Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Library databases. Eligible studies had to focus on the use of at least one of 15 antidepressants commonly used in MDD (i.e., agomelatine, bupropion, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, levomilnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine) and report data on treatment-emergent gastrointestinal SEs (i.e. nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, increased appetite and dry mouth) within 12?weeks of treatment.

Overall, 304 studies were included in the meta-analyses. **All the considered antidepressants showed higher rates of gastrointestinal SEs than placebo. Escitalopram and sertraline were shown to be the least tolerated antidepressants on the gastrointestinal tract, being associated with all the considered SEs with the exception of constipation and increased appetite, while mirtazapine was shown to be the antidepressant with fewer side effects on the gut, being only associated with increased appetite.**

In conclusion, commonly used antidepressants showed different profiles of gastrointestinal SEs, possibly related to their mechanisms of action. The specific tolerability profile of each compound should be considered by clinicians when prescribing antidepressants in order to improve adherence to treatment and increase positive outcomes in patients with MDD."

>Diversification is a widely proposed policing reform, but its impact is difficult to assess. We used records of millions of daily patrol assignments, determined through fixed rules and preassigned rotations that mitigate self-selection, to compare the average behavior of officers of different demographic profiles working in comparable conditions. Relative to white officers, Black and Hispanic officers make far fewer stops and arrests, and they use force less often, especially against Black civilians. These effects are largest in majority-Black areas of Chicago and stem from reduced focus on enforcing low-level offenses, with greatest impact on Black civilians. Female officers also use less force than males, a result that holds within all racial groups. These results suggest that diversity reforms can improve police treatment of minority communities.

And here's the link to the study: [**LINK**](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6530/696)

Also, figure 5 has some interesting results. In predominantly black and predominantly white areas, black officers stopped less people and used less force (10-20 less stops per shift). But Hispanic officers stopped at rates much closer to white officers. And in mixed areas or predominantly Hispanic areas, there wasn't nearly as much of a reduction in stops by black or Hispanic officers, and stranger still the effect we see seems more pronounced for black officers."

Abstract: 

 Respiratory insufficiency is a leading cause of death due to drug overdose or neuromuscular disease. We hypothesized that a stimulation paradigm using temporal interference (TI) could restore breathing in such conditions. Following opioid overdose in rats, two high frequency (5000?Hz and 5001?Hz), low amplitude waveforms delivered via intramuscular wires in the neck immediately activated the diaphragm and restored ventilation in phase with waveform offset (1?Hz or 60 breaths/min). Following cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), TI stimulation via dorsally placed epidural electrodes uni- or bilaterally activated the diaphragm depending on current and electrode position. In silico modeling indicated that an interferential signal in the ventral spinal cord predicted the evoked response (left versus right diaphragm) and current-ratio-based steering. We conclude that TI stimulation can activate spinal motor neurons after SCI and prevent fatal apnea during drug overdose by restoring ventilation with minimally invasive electrodes."
251,"From the study: “Several high-quality notes were produced, corresponding to the natural resonances of the conch shell. The intensity produced is approximately 100 dBA at 1 m of the conch. The sound is very directive, with the maximum energy situated in the axis of its aperture. We conducted spectral analyses with the free computer software package Praat (version 6.0.29). In Fig. 4, graphs 1 to 3 show the average spectra of three notes produced by the musician. The spectrum displays the fundamental frequency F0 of each note (256, 265, and 285 Hz, respectively, representing each time an interval of approximately ½ tone in a tempered musical system), as well as several harmonics whose frequencies are whole multiples of the F0. In addition to the F0 and harmonics, the analyses showed the presence of parasite energy corresponding to the noise described in the qualitative analysis of the sound. Note 3 (graph 3) contains the most noise. The spectrum also displays a decrease in energy according to the frequency. The lowest note is close to C and the two others are respectively close to a C-sharp and a D, equaling a halftone each time.”"

THC commonly causes orthostatic hypotension. This is the reason why people occasionally pass out or feel dizzy when standing a bit after consumption. 

This study is not particularly novel; it’s more looking at the safety and efficacy of using cannabis as a cardiovascular drug, and confirming that it does what we expected to happen. 

However, I will add that cannabis/THC is unlikely to be a particularly useful antihypertensive based on its mechanism of action. We already have antihypertensives that work the same way as cannabis, and they are not used frequently due to the frequency of side effects, which are a function of how they cause blood pressure lowering. It is worth further investigation, but this does not seem to have a high probability of being a game changer."

Abstract:

>Despite the increasing incidence and high morbidity associated with dementia, a simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive method of screening for dementia is yet to be discovered. This study aimed to examine whether artificial intelligence (AI) could distinguish between the faces of people with cognitive impairment and those without dementia.121 patients with cognitive impairment and 117 cognitively sound participants were recruited for the study. 5 deep learning models with 2 optimizers were tested. The binary differentiation of dementia / non-dementia facial image was expressed as a “Face AI score”. Xception with Adam was the model that showed the best performance. Overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy by the Xception AI system and AUC of the ROC curve were 87.31%, 94.57%, 92.56%, and 0.9717, respectively. Close and significant correlations were found between Face AI score and MMSE (*r* = ?0.599, *p* < 0.0001). Significant correlation between Face AI score and chronological age was also found (*r* = 0.321, *p* < 0.0001). However, MMSE score showed significantly stronger correlation with Face AI score than chronological age (*p* < 0.0001). The study showed that deep learning programs such as Xception have the ability to differentiate the faces of patients with mild dementia from that of patients without dementia, paving the way for future studies into the development of a facial biomarker for dementia."

262,"That’s my experience with wealthy techies. So many people from top tier universities talk about how “hard” it was growing up, and make it sound like landing that quarter-mil salary was some herculean uplifting from abject poverty. The right target questions will penetrate this often unrealized facade without them even noticing.

Ask questions like “what rank was your high school?”, or “what kind of SAT prep did you have to do?”, or “what extracurriculars were you in?” Asking about jobs they held in high school and college are also good ones. People tend to overlook how overwhelmingly their background is colored by their parents’ wealth, so asking “what” questions like this can cut through their own personal ego to excise the details of what their family could afford, which as we now know has *everything* to do with future earning potential. In tech it’s noticeable, as people from wealthy families can afford to take greater risks to reap greater rewards, because the floor is so much higher if they fail thanks to family wealth that one can fall back on."

It’s actually not uncommon for me to have this “mental” music psychosomatically cause me to cry, which is a really strange experience, especially if you’re out in public and suddenly start mentally hearing music and tearing up as a result of it.  

I wouldn’t trade it for anything, though.  The tears are ultimately of joy or some form of profound catharsis for me, and I value music that causes me to have intense psychosomatic experiences like that.  If I manage to write something that evokes that sort of reaction, I means that I’ve succeeded with that particular piece/passage, at least by my own standards.

## Abstract

Widespread acceptance of a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be the next major step in fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but achieving high uptake will be a challenge and may be impeded by online misinformation. To inform successful vaccination campaigns, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in the UK and the USA to quantify how exposure to online misinformation around COVID-19 vaccines affects intent to vaccinate to protect oneself or others. Here we show that in both countries—as of September 2020—fewer people would ‘definitely’ take a vaccine than is likely required for herd immunity, and that, relative to factual information, recent misinformation induced a decline in intent of 6.2 percentage points (95th percentile interval 3.9 to 8.5) in the UK and 6.4 percentage points (95th percentile interval 4.0 to 8.8) in the USA among those who stated that they would definitely accept a vaccine. We also find that some sociodemographic groups are differentially impacted by exposure to misinformation. Finally, we show that scientific-sounding misinformation is more strongly associated with declines in vaccination intent."
286,"Yes, a researcher using a substance will seem to have less integrity, but it isn't because of stereotypes, it is because they have something to gain from research showing positive results.
Abstinent researches could possibly be biased against the substance, which can be a problem, but it is much easier to argue a neutral position when you are abstinent than when you use the substance.

The tittle here claims it is about stereotypes, implying there is no logical reasons that could lead to this perception, but there absolutely are some valid reasons to be suspicious of researchers that already believe the substance they are researching is good, because that leads to confirmation bias. Research is about failing to disprove a hypothesis that you are assuming is false, if the hypothesis survives scrutiny and opposition then you can start to trust it.
When you assume it is true and just work to prove it, that can be a problem. 

A researcher that uses a substance must believe that it is not detrimental to them or that it is benefitial to them, they are much more likely to present favourable bias. They might not intentionally have less integrity, they might truly want to find truth rather than serve themselves, but bias does not need to be intentional, especially in research that has so much room for interpretation."

I am certain this applies not just to the government but now social media. Given the massive push for information control on social media platforms, this can only serve to exacerbate conspiracy theories, not stop them. These policies feed into the conspiracy narrative and give people *good reason* to believe things are being hidden from them and that people behind the scenes are trying to control the narrative and manipulate the thoughts of the public (because that is exactly what they are doing). It's irrelevant whether they are hiding the ""right"" things; besides the fact that it is impossible to reach consensus on what should be allowed (the conspiracy theorists will never agree with you, for a start) it is the presence of the policy itself that is direct evidence of conspiracy in the form of information control."

Abstract:

 Objective

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented changes to young adults’ lives, resulting in mental health difficulties for many; however, some individuals are particularly prone to heightened anxiety. Little is known about the early life predictors of anxiety during the pandemic. We examined a developmental pathway from behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized by fearful responses towards novelty, to changes in young adults’ anxiety during the initial period of the pandemic. We hypothesized that a stable pattern of BI across early childhood would predict greater adolescent worry dysregulation, which in turn would predict increases in young adult anxiety during a stressful phase of the pandemic.

Method

Participants (*N* = 291; 54% female) were followed from toddlerhood to young adulthood. BI was observed at ages 2 and 3. Social wariness was observed at age 7. Participants rated their worry dysregulation in adolescence (age 15) and anxiety in young adulthood (age 18) at two assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic, one month apart.

Results

A significant moderated mediation, in which a stable pattern of BI from toddlerhood to childhood, as compared to the absence of this pattern, predicted greater worry dysregulation in adolescence. Worry dysregulation predicted elevated young adult anxiety in the second assessment during COVID-19, even after accounting for the first assessment.

Conclusion

This study identifies a developmental pathway from toddlerhood BI to young adults’ elevated anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings have implications for early identification of individuals at risk for dysregulated worry and the prevention of anxiety during stressful life events in young adulthood."
295,"The authors find that brain fog due to COVID-19 is mediated by inflammatory factors in the brain, suggesting a role for anti-inflammatory treatments to manage this symptom. 

Summary

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a wide spectrum of neurologic dysfunction that emerges weeks after the acute respiratory infection. To better understand this pathology, we prospectively analyzed of a cohort of cancer patients with neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, including a targeted proteomics analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid. We find that cancer patients with neurologic sequelae of COVID-19 harbor leptomeningeal inflammatory cytokines in the absence of viral neuroinvasion. The majority of these inflammatory mediators are driven by type II interferon and are known to induce neuronal injury in other disease states. In these patients, levels of matrix metalloproteinase-10 within the spinal fluid correlate with the degree of neurologic dysfunction. Furthermore, this neuroinflammatory process persists weeks after convalescence from acute respiratory infection. These prolonged neurologic sequelae following systemic cytokine release syndrome lead to long-term neurocognitive dysfunction. Our findings suggest a role for anti-inflammatory treatment(s) in the management of neurologic complications of COVID-19 infection."
296,"This is really amazing news! I hope that this is really the first step toward a new huge boost in fighting cancer earlier and leading to saving millions of lives.

I also believe I can't use a chrome book due to this as the software would make it hard to find places I can download music from. 

My budget is under £300 preferably. I've heard multiple things about Lenova being a good brand. If the storage capacity is not limited by the music stuff, would this 64gb laptop below do for what I need?

345,"Hi everyone,I'm on the market for a new laptop. My old one is 7 years old and is starting to get me a little frustrated.I'm a software engineer and I occasionally run large projects, so high RAM and CPU consumption.I have a lenovo T540p, which I loved, as it is really sturdy and I abused it without having any problem ever.I don't game much, so not too fussy about having a good graphic card. I'm curious about your opinion. I've been a Lenovo enthusiast since 2005.I restricted the choice to a few models. The cheapest one is from PC Specialist, comes around £ 1000. Specs sounds great and seems good hardware, but I'm a little concerned about the build quality which might not be up to the one I'm used to with my Thinkpad. Unless I'm mistaken, it should be all components from CLEVO, which isn't bad.The specs are as follow:

Lafite' 15.6 pro:

*   i7-1165G7Display: 15.6 Matte full HD 60 Hz - 72% NTSC LED  widescreen 1920x1080 (need to confirm Nits)
*  32 GB RAM - 2 x16 GB Corsair 2666Mhz SoDimm DDR4
*  two  512 GB SSD drive, the primary a very fast Firecuda
*  Thunderbolt 4
*  integrated graphics

Second choice is a Lenovo Thinkpad E14 gen 2. Comes in so cheap that I wonder if they cut too much and the quality is not up to my old Thinkpad T540p.Price is great: around  £730 with these specs:

* i7-1165G7 Processor  RAM: 32GB DDR4 3200MHz SoDIMM
* 512 GB M.2 2242 SSD
* Display : 14.0"" FHD (1920x1080) TN Anti-glare 220nits Non-Touch Narrow
* Integrated Graphics

This might be my preferred choice, which comes arounr £1200 even though I'll lose thunderbolt (not that there is one in the E14 really..)

* AMD® Ryzen™ 7 PRO 4750U Processor, which seems a better choice than the i7 for my usage.
* RAM: 32GB (16GB Onboard+16GB SoDIMM) DDR4 3200MHz
* Solid State Drive : 1 TB PCIe SSD
* Display : 14.0"" FHD (1920x1080) IPS Anti-glare 400nits Non-Touch Narrow 72% NTSC Low Power
* Integrated Graphics

I've been looking at DELL, and the closest I can get to spec and price is a precision, which has specs very similar to the PC specialist one, and comes around £1300, so I'd tend to exclude it unless you can convince me it's a better choice than the others.What are your thoughts on this? I'm tempted to get the E14, with its limitation because the price is so good."

350,"I found that the best laptop in my budget is a lenovo v15 and it's sold with the same specs in 2 versions, one with the Intel i3 10110g cpu and the other with the and ryzen 3-3250u. Which one would be best?

I guess the Intel pushes more on single core apps and ryzen in multicore. Overall for office work and browsing which cpu is best suited?"
351,"I will prefer Asus.
Reasons.
1. More Storage - 1TB vs 256 GB. 256 GB may seem a lot but it will fill up pretty quick. 1 TB wont fill up that quick ( unless you are going to download a lot of Games, SoftwareS, Movies etc.
2. Windows - Lenovo has Windows in S mode which is good but the problem is Windows in S mode can't run app which is not installed from the Windows Store. And that's not a good move. But you can remove it easily. Just check up on how to remove that, it will be there on internet.  Meanwhile, Asus has full Windows 10 so no hassle at all. 

Other than that, I find no difference.

Intel vs AMD is not a huge factor if we consider light tasks. Unless heavy tasks/gaming, you are pretty okay with Intel or AMD.

It was just a bad hard drive and I replaced it with a new SSD, and went ahead and put 2 brand new sticks of RAM in it (to a total of 8gb over the stock 4gb) and I also replaced the battery with a brand new replacement. I did all of this because she wanted it fixed. When I brought it to her she had apparently already went out and bought a new laptop, but said I could keep the one she gave me. Any ideas what I could sell it for with these upgrades? It's got a 5th gen Core i5 in it.

You will probably be able to run Windows in parallels with nearly the same (or better) performance than on an equivalently priced Intel notebook. (Parallels is for purchase software.)  If you do purchase Parallels, you will have the ability to run other OSes as well...  (Cyber security in mind here.)  Parallels is still a work in progress though, we will see if they can step up on this.

Gaming on the Macbook Pro M1 is far better than an equivalently priced Intel box.  Once you step up to a GTX 1660, the GTX will slightly edge out the Macbook Pro M1.

I came across this laptop : [https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/hp-omen-15-6-gaming-laptop-black-intel-i7-10750h-1tb-ssd-16gb-ram-geforce-rtx-2060/14637639](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/hp-omen-15-6-gaming-laptop-black-intel-i7-10750h-1tb-ssd-16gb-ram-geforce-rtx-2060/14637639)

I was checking [https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-3720QM-vs-Intel-Core-i7-10750H/m1619vsm1053158](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-3720QM-vs-Intel-Core-i7-10750H/m1619vsm1053158) this and realized that the switch from 2012 macbook pro 15 maybe worth it.

What do you guys think about it ? I will primarily use it for programming, and a very minor bit of gaming like a warzone match here or there."
387,"Lenovo Legion 5 or HP Omen. When it comes to gaming laptops it is very important to choose the ones that have the best cooling systems and these two offer one of the best cooling systems on the market. Better cooling means that CPU and GPU will be able to draw more power without overheating and throttling, thus higher clock speeds and higher FPS in games.

Or you can look at ASUS TUF Gaming, which is the cheapest, but it has terrible cooling system and display. Since you are looking for external monitor you can go with ASUS that will have better specs than Lenovo or HP and buy external display to compensate laptop's display.

I do not know what to say about external displays and keyboards, I am not an expert here. Though I know that mechanical keyboards are the best for gaming (but there is no laptop that has one) and they are generally more expensive than average keyboard."

You need a processor model of the H series (High Performance Graphics processor) or HQ (High performance graphics processor models).

397,"Hey! I'm saving up to get myself a new laptop for Christmas & have been doing a whole bunch of comparison shopping but I'm not a big techie and honestly I'm kind of overwhelmed, haha. I'll be using it for school, digital art (so colour accuracy is pretty important-- this is one of the big reasons I'm needing a new laptop, my current screen is useless), and gaming.

I'm not a super serious gamer, but I'd like to be able to run newer RPGs on medium/high at least. Right now my laptop can barely limp through Dragon Age Inquisition at 30 fps on the very lowest settings, so, y'know. Low bar.

Decent battery life would be a plus. I'm a writer so it'd be nice to have something I can occasionally take somewhere else to work on for an hour or two without needing a plug, but I'm not expecting all-day use from something I can game on. My budget is \~$2500 US (thank you to my essential service job, lol), but that can bend a little if it needs to.

A friend of mine recommended the Dell XPS 15, but I've seen some folks say it's not great for gaming and I've had bad experiences with Dell tech support in the past, too. The other ones I was looking at were the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (though I'd prefer a 15-inch) and the Razer Blade 15. 

I know it's a bit of a tall order looking for both screen quality and gaming chops, but any thoughts/suggestions/etc would be very much appreciated! Thanks in advance :)"
398,"Main issue is overheating. So never keep temps high (80-90 degrees) for a long time. Otherwise this will cripple either your CPU or GPU.
You can swap paste one the chip to better one. It can lower temps by additional 5 degrees. I do not know which brand is good, but there are plenty of videos on YouTube.
Folks already wrote about stands, so I will not repeat that.
You can try to remove bottom lid and use it like that if nothing above mentioned will not lower your temps substantially (I used to do like this on my old Lenovo, it lowered temps by an additional 10 degrees, yikes)."

407,"You are comparing apple with an orange. These two are completely different classes of machines. First one is a premium business laptop dedicated only for working. Second one is a consumer gaming laptop. First one has way better build quality and portability. It works on lower clockspeeds so your laptop does not overheat and worked for a longer amount of time. Second one pushes its chips to their full limits to squeeze out every single FPS in your games. Generally overheating is not good in long term standpoint.

i9-10980HK (8-Core, 16MB Cache, up to 5.3GHz w/ Turbo Boost 2.0)

- Dell precision 7550 ($5,191)
i9-10885H (8 Core, 16MB Cache, 2.40 GHz to 5.30 GHz)
NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 w/8GB GDDR6

It seems that the Alienware has a much better GPU for deep learning than the Dell, their CPU has very similar performance (maybe slightly better in the Alienware for some tasks), and they have the same amount of RAM and storage. The Alienware has better screen, design, and is larger. Yet, the Dell computer costs almost $2,000 more. Any thoughts? Are they overcharging for the looks, just because it targets businesses?"
423,"Hi there,

So next schoolyear I will need a laptop and I have been struggling with deciding. I still have plenty of time to think about this but I don't think it's wrong to give myself an idea of what I should buy. Not long ago I came up with the idea of buying an RTX 2070 powered laptop paired with a desktop Ryzen 5. I chose for a gaming laptop because I would like to play games on the go aswell. Then later I decided it might not be practical to take it to school as these kinda laptops don't last long on a single charge and are usually really big and heavy. I'm not planning on serious gaming on the laptop though. I own a ryzen 9 desktop which I will be putting an RX 6800 XT in later. I'm fine with playing games at medium settings, so casual gaming on the go. After some research I found out that a 14 inch laptop could be a nice portable option. But the highest powered GPU I could find on it was a 1650 ti mobile. Then after some other research on the 1650 ti mobile people said that they won't recommend it as it's not futureproof for 1080p and that development of hardware goes instantly fast  which turned me off to buy a 1650 ti mobile powered 14 inch laptop.. After some MORE research I found that Apple has released their new macbook air with an M1 chip and it's 13,3 inch hurray! Though it's said that the M1 chip delivers almost the same performance as the 1050 ti which performances (I assume less than a 1650 ti mobile). Plus the macbook air doesn't have usb ports which is also a turn off for me, aswell as the expensive upgrade solutions. Maybe it's good for you to know that I mostly play GTA 5, Rocket League, Fortnite, Dolphin and PCSX2. Of course I want to run it smooth and I don't mind turning down the settings to medium for 1080p. I know that in this post I have only on about gaming but if you can game on a laptop then you most definitely will be able to do schoolwork on it aswell. Also the max I want to spend on this laptop is 1500 euro. If you have any questions you can ask them right away and I'm excited to see the advice you want to give to me."

433,"I have a pretty good offer for a Prestige 14. But after reading some reviews I'm getting more and more skeptical. People say it gets hot and noisy but I need a laptop and not a hairdryer. Also, I've read that you can tweak some things and undervolt the gpu/cpu to make the Prestige 14 more usable. But I'm not that experienced and not sure if this is going to be endlessly annoying.

* I need the laptop mostly for data journalism/coding and maybe some light gaming. 
* Probably I'm going to install some Linux version on it. 
* Sometimes I might edit photos with it.
* I plan to take it with me when I go to work. That means riding a train for two hours pretty much every day.
* Also, it would be nice to have something with an Nvidia Graphics Card so I can try some deep learning. (However, I never did that before and probably won't really need it that much.)

What do you think? Does it make sense to buy a Prestige 14? I'm not in a hurry to buy a new laptop and better offers might come. But just from the specs, this one looks really nice in theory."
434,"Morning from Texas!

I reach out to y'all today for advice on a new laptop. As we all know, the 3000 series gpu's will be coming soon (as early as late February if I recall) along with amd's 5000 series cpu's.

With that being said, let me give you some context. I currently have a dell xps 15 9570 with 32gb ram 512gb ssd and the 1080p panel. I absolutely adore this laptop but the lack of graphics horsepower for gaming and video editing on davinci has hindered me a lot.

Currently, I have been considering 2 laptops, the legion 5 and 7, but more so the 7 due to it's closer build quality and metal body over the 5. BUT the 7 does not have a current amd version

Legion 5 with the specs I want is 1099 and legion 7 with a 2070 super is 1399

So, with the new stuff coming out (3070 starting at 1299), I am looking for a high refresh rate, amd cpu, and rtx graphics card, with a budget right at 1400, should I buy the new stuff, or a current generation when prices drop?

Thanks in advance"

Chrome alone can use 4+GB if you have a lot of tabs open; and if you switch between that, Discord, and a game like Ark; you'll already start suffering.     Try to do that playing Minecraft while running your own Minecraft server with 8GB and you'll be very limited in the worlds you make.

452,"URGENT HELP, going to University in 2 years



OKAY so I’m really indecisive so this will be long but I really need your help guys!!

So I’m going to university in 2 years and I’m looking for a laptop to be able to use there and be able to game with too! A pc would be good but my parents aren’t really on that thought it is my money - kind of.

So what I need is a laptop with good specs preferably 1660 ti and up, last more than 4 years, light weight and with not a blatant GAMER laptop design. 

Thing is, all the laptops like that: HP OMEN 15 (core i7, rtx 2060, 512 ssd), ASUS ROG STRIX G15 (core i7, rtx 2060, 1TBSSD but no webcam) MSI STEALTH GS66 (core i7, rtx 2060, 512 ssd) and Lenovo Legion  5P (AMD RYZEN 7, rtx 2060 and 256 GB SSD - it is the only one with 8GB RAM, rest at 16GB RAM. It also has no webcam like the rog) are all around 1000 and up with Lenovo legion starting at £999 and the MSI STEALTH being the most expensive at £1400. 


The Lenovo legion looks good but I know I will have to upgrade it as it only has 256 ssd, also it does not have a webcam. Though I’m not sure if I’ll need to use my laptop webcam in university when I’ll have a phone. What do you think guys? Is a webcam needed? 

Also, the msi stealth and hp omen seem beautiful to me it’s just that they’re REALLY expensive.

The ROG’s downfalls to me are least is that it doesn’t have a webcam but if I don’t need it then it might be fine AND also that it’s expensive. 

I would’ve got a normal laptop and bought a pc but space is quite the problem but I can make a compromise if people feel like it is the best decision. 

I do have the money for the most expensive laptop but it will take ALL of my savings and I would only really want to do that if I know that the laptop will be worth it. 

I want to be able to use it in 4 years, what is best guys? 

It’s just thinking that I could be using over £1000 for way more things but I’m using it for only one laptop I don’t want to be losing out a lot from it and want it to be worth the sacrifice! 


Note I also probably won’t be playing that much since I may be entering uni but I want that flexibility.

454,What is the make and model of the computer and what version of Windows is it? Your information is a bit vague to really tell you anything about whats wrong but since you can see the time on the bottom of the screen clearly the computer is turning on and booting to Windows.  Does your mouse move at all and if you hit the little Windows key on the lower left side of your keyboard does the start menu pop up?
455,"Well, I am not sure about the keyboard on Surface 3, but I own a Thinkpad t490 (which is basically the same as X13), and I love the keyboard. I did own a Zenbook, which also had a very good keyboard, but the key travel was shorter and the layout was a little bit unnatural for me. Sometimes I did some typos on Zenbook, since the key was not there where I expected it to be. On Thinkpad I do not have such a problem.

Generally Thinkpads are known not only for their robust design and easy maintenance, but also for a good keyboard among laptops. On average they have bigger key travels that others and for the most of users it is the major reason to favor it over other keyboards.

You can ask them to give both and you can see for yourself which keyboard is better."

460,"I’m looking for a new laptop for school work which typically requires me to do lots of research and essay writing work. I normally use 30-100 tabs on chrome when doing research work. I would also like to do a little light gaming on the side, games like: Minecraft, The Sims 4 and possibly a few other games like Batman Arkham. My top requirement in terms of gaming would just be a laptop that can handle Minecraft and The Sims 4. I also like to stream or watch a lot of films and shows on my laptop, which means that I would need the screen to be pretty decent in terms of colouration and at least 1440x900. Furthermore, I’m looking for portability and strong battery life, around 6-8 hours the very least. As for portability, 1.7-1.8kg would be the heaviest. Thermals should be pretty decent too as I tend to use my laptop on my lap a lot of the time. The size of the screen should be around 13-15.6 inch. I need the built quality of both the processors and the laptop’s body to last me around 5-6 years. Definitely needs a webcam as well. My budget is around $1000-$1500USD. 

I am also quite torn up about picking MacOS or Windows as I am currently a 2015 Mac Air 13’’ user. Surprisingly, this Mac has been able to handle Minecraft for the last 5 years of using it. My main concern is not being used to the Windows set up, but I am also aware that Windows are better when it comes to gaming. I am also curious and want to try using a Windows laptop. However, the only Windows laptop that I have been considering and meets up my description is the MSI Prestige 15. I’ve heard a lot of complaints about the built quality from MSI being problematic and one of my close friend got a GS65 a few months back and they had to get it fixed twice already and it’s still having problems here and there. 

Laptops that I have been looking into and considering: 
	
	Macbook Pro 13’’ with the M1 chip.
		- Pros: 
			- Great battery life
			- Great built and portability 
			- Great processor 
			- Amazing thermals 
			- Compatible with my other electronics as I am also an iPhone and iPad user
			- Decent Service
		- Cons: 
			- Is it worth the price?? (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT)
			- First gen chip
			- Compatibility issues, in terms of applications (due to the new chip and Apple being, well Apple)
			- VERY EXPENSIVE TO FIX OR SERVICE
	
	MSI Prestige 15
		- Pros:
			- Great processors 
			- Good battery life ?
			- Very portable 
			- Decent thermals??? (I’ve heard people having problems about this so…)
		- Cons:
			- Thermals :))) 
			- Some people have also been complaining about issues with the battery
			- BUILT QUALITY. I’m pretty sure most of the time, MSI’s questionable built quality is what caused a lot of these issues as some people said it’s great while others said otherwise. 			- Basically, a lot of factory defects. 
			- BAD SERVICE

I have a Dell Inspiron 15 7572 and some keys on are failing or not working at all.

I found a non backlit keyboard for cheap, however, before making the purchase, I open it up to see if I could easily replace it. And when I got everything out I saw a metal cover and I have no idea how to open to gain access to the keyboard. 

Haven't seen a screw, or anything like it, just small ""blackheads"". At first I believe that it could be welded, but I'm pretty sure the palmrest is plastic. So I don't really have a clue how I suppose to change it and a entire new Palmrest with a new keyboard built-in is 4 times the price of the keyboard itself.

476,"Total budget and country of purchase: £200, UK. If there are better ones I could stretch this depending how good the specs are.

Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. Would want a long lasting battery, something I don't have to charge loads. 10 hours + preferably. 

How important is weight and thinness to you? Would like something fairly light but if it makes any other specification dip due to this then I'd rather have a heavier laptop. 

Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux. Dont mind. Prefer something I don't need to buy anti virus stuff for every year. Where I don't have to look after security as much. Had a mac book before so I didn't worry about security at all when I had that.

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A. Something to watch streamed movies on comfortably. 13inch or bigger perhaps? 

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. No games as I want a separate laptop for this stuff. Something I can use photos hop on would be good though just incase I have to use it in the future. Will want to download loads of music in the future so fast downloads speeds. 

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? No games

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)? Something that will run quickly and easily without me having to constantly install updates that much/worry about too much. 

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. I will be using this mostly for uni work stuff. With essays and multiple tables open for when I have to research stuff online. So want something that can handle this. I also watch movies loads and will be looking for something that can handle this nicely, hence a long battery. I also will be downloading loads of music so would like nice download speeds. Want it to last 10 years ideally as I won't be using it that much, only to do essays, writing stuff and streamed movies. Only download a large amount of music every 6months or longer sometimes.

479,"I have a Asus that runs windows 8 and I've had it for about four years now. The body itself is quite literally held together with electrical tape and pops off the hinge every time I close it. But the software and everything inside of the laptop runs perfectly.

When I did get the laptop it was from one of my mothers coworkers for $1. They wanted to upgrade and were looking for any excuse to get rid of the laptop and I worked nicely. But because it was practically given away there are some minor annoyances with it. Most of the software for the business was left on, and for the most part that's fine; I enjoy having free access to the entirety of Microsoft office suite after all. But there's also software I can't identify and don't know the purpose of. I.E. ""Classic Shell"" ""Atheros Communications"" ""MasteryNet course Player."" 

To make things more annoying even though I deleted the previous owners profile from the laptop after giving myself admin status it still treats me as a secondary user at time. For most of the computer's lifespan I've been unable to regularly update as it's a coin flip if it will recognize my status as admin.

I want to start from scratch and do a full reset of the laptop and clear out everything. But of course that would mean wiping out my access to Microsoft office and all of the applications I've downloaded since buying the laptop. I'm wondering if there's a way to have both a reset laptop and be able to keep my apps. (The most important thing to me is Microsoft office. If I have to download Discord again I'll live.)

481,"Answers.

1. SSD & More Ram. 
2. SSD will improve the speed of the entire device. I am not sure of FPS ( I ain't that nerdy to see this ... I just play game and see if it works or not ) but I think there will be a gain in FPS. Load & Write speed - Guaranteed increase.
3. If you can buy a 1TB SSD for your laptop ( while being in budget ), then just put it. If you have less money, then you can try to buy a smaller SSD ( either 512 or 256 GB SSD ) and install it on your device ( internally if possible ). If internally not possible, then buy an external SSD and keep your game stuff there. Just keep non-essential stuff in your HDD.
4. More ram means more performance gains. But that also depends how fast that works. In some rams, you might have seen this number "" 3600 MHz "" . Well, this is the speed of the ram. Some have less and some have more. So, try to buy RAMs with more storage ( such as 2 sticks of 8 GB or 1 stick of 16 GB if there is only one slot ) and with a faster speed.
5. Yes, I would recommend Crucial RAM becuase it's good. And also if you are stuck which RAM you want to buy then you can just allow Crucial to scan your laptop so that it can find the best possible RAM configs or you can manually type in the required info by the crucial.
6. NOTE  - I recommend going with either 16 GB or 32 GB RAM and if there are 2 slots then pair it. ( 2 sticks of 8 or 2 sticks of 16 )
7. NOTE - I haven't researched more of your laptop so check if you can install an SSD while keeping your HDD intact. The best thing that you can do is to remove the HDD and just install SSD internally ( 1TB ). But since the SSDs are not cheap, so you can buy and external one and use it for keeping game stuff.
8. NOTE - Any more questions ? you can still ask, I will be there for help."

493,Try changing the Bios SATA to AHCI.  You may need to reinstall OS.  I don't think you can move the SSD from a 6530 to a 6420 and get it to boot either.  The drivers will be very different since the laptops are a generation apart.
494,"Tiger Lake is a little better at Photoshop, ryzen is better at video editing, and 3d rendering is largely dependant on your gpu. Intel iris Xe is a bit better than Vega if you're using integrated graphics. 
Also consider the features coming with the laptops. Unfortunately, only Intel laptops have thunderbolt support, as a thunderbolt 4 controller is included in tiger lake cpu's themselves. 

Overall I think the ryzen is better, as it is a lot better in some things, and only slightly worse in others, but you can get higher quality laptops with Intel at the moment, until ryzen 5000 drops sometime next year.
I'd personally choose Ryzen, depending on availability and options."

I remember the exact day I got this laptop ([https://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/HP\_Star\_Wars\_laptop/overview.html](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/HP_Star_Wars_laptop/overview.html)), 12/5/15, so it's just over 5 years old.

The only physical damage this laptop has is a crack on the right corner of the keyboard panel, right where the laptop is connected to the screen where it opens and closes. It does not affect it being opened or closed, though.

The only other problem with it, is when you turn it on and only when you load up a game, it will almost always flash these tiny little lines in the screen, kind of like TV static, but it's so minimal that sometimes you don't notice it, and it will sometimes flash a black screen really quickly.

That's all the problems I can point out.

505," The following will explain how to properly care for your [new laptop battery](https://mylaptopspare.com/product-category/laptop-batteries/) to get the optimum usage out of it. This is done by utilizing a simple charging cycle to ensure long-running times and your laptop battery's overall lifetime.

Before you use it for the first time, it is crucial to cycle fully, or condition, your battery. Brand new batteries need to be conditioned religiously in the beginning at least eight to twenty times. One cycle is a full charging followed by a full discharging. If you do not do this, you will not get the most runtime from your battery that you could be. For instance, it is widespread for people to think that their battery is faulty when, in actuality, they have not conditioned the battery properly. In other words, nothing is wrong with their battery, only how they have been charging and discharging it.

When you first get your new laptop, the battery will not be charged or conditioned. It is not a good idea to turn on your computer until you have done at least one full charge and discharge of the battery.

To reach the full capacity of the battery, it will normally take between eight and ten charges. However, most batteries will not reach their utmost capacity until they have been conditioned a minimum of fifty times. Until this benchmark, you may not experience the best performance.

The first time you charge your laptop, the indicator may show that it is full after only fifteen minutes or so of charging. Although this is normal, it certainly does not mean that your battery is actually full. If this does occur, take out the battery and then put it back in, repeating the charging procedures. Then, without the laptop ac adapter plugged in, let the battery run completely out. Repeat this same procedure at least eight times over the next few days. Always be sure to give your battery a full overnight charge.

Regular disposable batteries for toys and other household appliances are used in many different apparatuses. Laptop batteries are of the rechargeable type and are often also commonplace in the household. Laptop batteries are made out of a material known as nickel-cadmium. These are also the types of batteries found in cell phones. Just a little known fact: these batteries require over fifty times the energy they make.

At one point or another, you will need to replace your laptop battery. When that time comes, knowing how to dispose of these kinds of batteries properly is vital to our planet's health. Some battery manufacturers still include mercury as one of the main ingredients in the making of rechargeable batteries. This is just one of the reasons that knowing how to recycle batteries properly is important.

Many laptop manufacturers will operate a recycling program so that when you no longer need your laptop battery, you can return it to them to dispose of properly. As nickel-cadmium batteries are particularly hazardous, it is important to look i"

507,"Hi !
After 5 years of good and loyal service, I have to part with my Asus Zenbook UX305CA.
I had bought this computer when I entered university (physics/math study) for 500€ (the base price was 700€, but it was on special offer).

Configuration :

Intel core M3 6Y30, 2 cores, 0.9 GHz base, 2.1 GHz boost

4 GB ram

128 GB of storage

1920x1080 matte screen with very good contrast and fidelity

3 USB 3.0 ports, 1 full-format SD card port, 1 micro HDMI port, 1 jack, 1 power supply

The configuration seems ridiculous today (and it was already ridiculous at the time ??) but with hindsight I was never really limited. I learned how to program Python and C on it, and when I needed more power, the university always provided us with SSH remote access machines.

In terms of design, I think it has aged particularly well. Except maybe the large screen borders, it is still in fashion with its all-aluminum frame, its large track pad and especially its very complete connectors for its size

2. IMO, I would love to have higher refresh rate in my machine. And Asus has 300Hz display which is ridiculously high !

I also suggest the Elektronics one ( although I have never used it & probably the first time of hearing the name of the brand ) because of the display. It has qhd display with 165Hz rate.

\--

So, if you want to buy the very best ( out of two ), then you should go for XPS 15. It may be pricier but it's a premium laptop and since it's well received by the reviewers, so I guess it's a good choice.

If you want to buy a laptop with a good value and you prioritise your budget, then go for Aspire 7. It's a good laptop in it own right. Although in terms of pure performance ( I mean benchmarks ), then yeah XPS is goin' to crush it but IMO if I see not a huge difference between the two devices, then it won't matter which one to choose since that will only make difference in extreme cases ( such as Video Rendering ) and little difference in normal day-to-day tasks. 

So if you want something premium & powerful then go for XPS.

If you want something powerful but keeping the wallet okay, then go for Aspire 7.

Both of them are quite good so the thing that may matter more is design, service centres near your area ( I live in village so I considered that as well ) & other features that you can clearly look up that as well.

I hope that helps !! Have a good day !"

Here are the things that you can do. 

1. Install an SSD internally. And install the OS on it. And just keep the HDD as the storage for non-essential stuff. Anything which is essential for you ( games or software which ypu really need to go fast ) install it on SSD

2. Buy external SSD if not possible to install it internally ( or you don't want to open up the laptop because you don't want to mess up )

3. Give it back to the place from where you bought and retrieve the cash. And then use it to buy the laptop with a similiar specs with a SSD. 

4. If none of them are possible then cry over it.

532,"If you want to do photo/video editing in a laptop, then definitely you will need a good display and at least Intel Tiger Lake or Ryzen 4xxxU series CPUs, or external GPU if you want to render videos much much faster.
Probably you should reconsider Macbooks on M1 chips, since they offer great display and performance for the money. Otherwise, these kinds of specs can cost you much more.
Other from Macbooks among laptops with that offer good displays and external GPUs are Dell XPS, ASUS Rog Zephyrus G14, Razer Blade lineups. Pick among these and you will not be mistaken (just make sure that you are buying the display with 100% color coverage option).
Personally from Windows laptops I would recommend ASUS Rog Zephyrus G14 on AMD. Check reviews for it. It has good display and external GPU, also good battery life for daily usage."
533,"Oh wise Redditors,

I have a (huge) slight dilemma. I'm at a crossroads of choosing between a mighty 4800H and a powerful i7-1167G7.
Though I have no problems getting either, the biggest difference I see is that the Intel has USB 4 and thunderbolt 3/4 plus LDDR4 memory while the Ryzen only has USB 3.2 and DDR4. One is a multi thread beast the other single. 

The question is USB4, TB4 and LDDR4 really worth the extra extra premium for an ultrabook that only has integrated graphics? Or there are others I have to consider or be concerned of.

My uses: light gaming, maybe some photo editing (not Photoshop) and regular surfing. I'd like the laptop to be future proof. I'm looking at the Lenovo Slim 7(i) pro (or if you guys have a different suggestion). I also don't really want to wait for zen 3 as I will be never-endingly wanting new tech.

I am looking for a new laptop and pretty much narrowed it down to the Lenovo Legion 5. I need it for working (standard Office applications), netflixing, but also want to be able to play World of Warcraft in 1920×1080 without any hiccups. 

My main requirement would be that the laptop runs as quiet as possible while working and browsing the internet and to have a good battery life while doing so. While gaming (WoW only), i would of course accept louder fan noise, it just should run smoothly there. 

Which configuration of the Legion 5 would you advice for this? I thought about the Ryzen 7 4800H in combination with an RTX 2060 and 16GB ram. Or would you say that this is overkill for my needs, and let's say a Ryzen 5 4600H or an i5-10300 with a 1650ti would be enough and maybe give better thermals and thus be quieter / have battery life?

If it's not charging up all the way it might have a failed or otherwise faulted cell in the battery pack- and once unplugged the remaining cell configuration isn't able to power the computer properly, resulting in it cutting out. My advice is return the battery and go from there, either by letting the manufacturer replace it (you might have just gotten a dud, it does happen sometimes) or moving to something else from another manufacturer. Genuine Dell batteries cost more, but the warranty on them is worth it imho.

Those who went through the preorder with the Z Fold 2 with the custom hinges received their orders pretty close to the expected date. Those customers received the same info (or rather, lack of info) that we have had.  It is also important to note that they were able to find what they referred to as SJON, which was a targeted/expected date of shipping from the factory/warehouse as Samsung themselves do not have solid contact with their own factory.

People need to stop acting like Samsung failed again with Exynos this year. They have closed to the gap to a certain degree (obviously, they didn't close it completely as Snapdragon edges Exynos especially in GPU performance). But they have closed it to the point that whichever one you get, you're good to go.

I called Samsung, under their direction I took it to a local place called ""UBreakIFix"". They told me they could replace the camera in an hour. So, 3 hours later when they finally finish, it's not fixed. And I am 100% certain they didn't even take the camera apart because MY fingerprint was still on the lens (I purposely put a noticeable thumb print right smack dab in the middle of the rear screen that covers the lenses so I could tell if it was replaced). Because I had to go back to work I left. I then sent the phone directly into Samsung for them to repair, 2 weeks later, I get it back. It said they replaced the motherboard, but guess what, camera is still blurry! I called back, they said they would ship me a NEW phone since I have been having problems that cant seem to be sorted out, but they were out of stock and I am to call back and check periodically. Eventually 2 months go by, on one of my checks to see if one is in stock, the claims guy said ""we only repair phones, we never send new ones out"". Totally contradicting what I have been told, and I have this $1400 phone with a proclaimed brilliant camera I cannot use. He did even admit he saw where they promised me a new unit. But still, I sent the phone in.... Received it back today, it says they replaced the ""LCD assembly"" but guess what! Camera still blurry!!!! What do I have to do to get a working phone? It is under the original warranty plus I have the insurance thru Samsung. With the very last time I sent it in, I have 11 phone calls in to them totaling over 3 hours worth. No less than 12 dropped calls, literally over 40 transfers. Every time I call it is like starting over.

587,"Hi all,

I've had my S7E since Jan 2016 and she's finally starting to show obvious signs of age. I'd like to upgrade, but I've hit the classic Exynos vs. Snapdragon dilemma. Only the former is available in my country, unless I purchase the S20FE...which I WOULD do, if I wasn't planning on moving OS in a few months (for work) and needing a dual sim model. Only single-sim S20FEs are available here in Australia. It's annoying.

So, to my question - I know the main complaints about the Exynos are the battery life under heavy pressure (i.e) gaming, and that the SD is just a better chip in general. I don't play any games (other than Fire Emblem Heroes, which runs fine on my old S7E), and I really just use my phone for internet/social media browsing, calls/texts, Spotify and photos.  I would much prefer to buy local for less risk/warranty availability, but the feedback I've heard about Exynos makes me reluctant to purchase it, especially since (you might have noticed) I prefer to keep my phones for at least 3-5 years before switching. I see them as investments, so I when I replace them I like to get the best.

So I'm curious - do you think I'd notice the difference in performance, coming from such an old model, if I bit the bullet and bought a local S20+ dual-sim Exynos vs. buying an international SD version of the same phone? 

(As an aside, if you've got any thoughts about getting the S20FE vs. the S20+, I'd love to hear them. I think I'm pretty set on the S20+ at this point.)"
588,I work at an appliance store. And Samsung have one of the worst service if things go south. You either get lucky with a good unit or plagued to hell and back with their customer service. Depending on your price point.  GE and Bosch are the best (build and post sale service)
589,If it doesn't exist why wouldn't Samsung just straight up say we're discontinuing the line so people can flock to the S21 instead? I feel like we should be hearing some rumors about hardware specs or something by now? Last year we got info pretty early around the S20 launch.
590,"I have a note10+ running the latest version on Samsung notes in Canada. I noticed that my locked notes appear in OneNote unlocked in the feed section. Since Samsung cloud is shutting down and they wanted us to sync with OneDrive instead, I've done so but wasn't expecting my locked notes to appear unlocked. Does that mean they are being stored unsecurely?

  


Even my notes from my secure folder are appearing there.

  


Anyone else experiencing this?"
591,Mine did not. So disappointed. I had to use it without a screen protector because mine wasn't delivered yet. Now it has a few scratches. I don't even know how it got scratches. I used a flip cover with it.
592,"Got the OneUI 3.1 update on my Tab S7+, hoping that a major update would fix the green tint. Guess what, it's still there in all its glory. It somehow even feels worse. There's heavy gradient going from pink/purple-ish to green. It doesn't really affect my day-to-day use but just the fact that Samsung doesn't acknowledge it alone is annoying. There's also the less than mediocre battery life."
593,"Cost of labor in the ""old UE"" is so high that it is not possible to repair cheap devices at a reasonable cost. For example in Belgium you have to pay around 30 EUR per hour for your employee when you include all hidden taxes. So if the repair of a broken component requires 5 hours of work (diagnosis takes a lot of time) it would cost 150 EUR + 10 EUR for some electronic parts = 160 EUR. 
That's why the ""repair"" in UE is done by replacing whole components instead of fixing them and that's why these parts are so expensive. But it can be done within one hour so the labor cost is low."
594,"I was thinking about the possible S21 FE. They removed a bunch of things for the S21 already and I'm not exactly sure what they would remove to make the FE cheaper. I had a different idea. It could be a true ""Fan Edition"". My idea was that they could have a phone with all the features they've removed over the years. So they would add back in the 1440p screen with SD card support. It would have MST and include a charger in the box. Or at least have an option on the website to add it to your order for free. Maybe have an option for glass or plastic back. Heck, maybe they can even add a headphone jack to the phone. Sort of a ""legacy"" phone with all the features from over the years."
595,"Same in US. Pre-ordered navy immediately after the reveal, got 2 emails about the order being received, and has been in processing ever since with zero updates. Now looking at March 16th for ""expected ETA."" Chatted with a support agent and he also had no idea which is kind of ridiculous (not his fault, he was super nice and gave me his personal contact info if I had any questions or if he got any updates about it), but still, you'd expect a company with Samsung's reach to at least have their shit together for orders at a minimum ??"
596,"So as you can tell I’m trying to order the s21+ online through Samsung.com- whenever I seem to get to the part where I checkout it won’t let me- for whatever reason it just stops at that page. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong- but it’s just not letting me do it. I’ve used other browsers. I’m halfway tempted to use my laptop to try it- but my husband is on a zoom call. I am using an iPhone- I don’t know if that is making a difference or not.

Thanks for your help."
597,Someone please tell me you know the name or even the singer of the song in this advert. It’s driving me up the wall. Shazam has no hits and googling the lyrics hasn’t helped. Sounds a lot like K. Flay to me but probably isn’t. Need to know!
598,"In the 20 series the main  difference is battery unless your running back to back benchmarks everyday (which it doesn't sound like you are). I have an S20 and the battery life is excellent, idle isn't great to start but if you use power saver with AOD off and airplane mode on, it drains almost nothing on idle, I work 3-4 hour shifts sometimes and it'll drain a single percent sitting there. (Exynos Australia)"
599,"I received an S21+ as a work phone replacement for a beloved S9+ with a battery that no longer lasted me through the day.

I haven’t even used this phone for a week and I’m so frustrated with it.

For starters it‘s just plain bulky. It’s heavier by far, which is even more insulting to me considering what I’ve had to give up in return.

The camera is a joke. And I don’t mean in comparison to ultras or iPhone pros or anything. I mean in comparison to my S9+. I took side by side shots and the S9+ delivers far more clarity. Less noise, less blur, the S21+ even does this weird blur around the edges. Indoor and outdoor, bright or dark, the S21+ delivers poor shots every time.

The headphone jack is gone, which I know, old news, but it’s still frustrating as hell that the price went up $500, the weight went up, and you still can’t include either a headphone jack or a dongle in the box for me? Stop trying to be Apple and be better for your paying customers.

No SD card slot. I’m not a huge user of this, but the few times I’ve needed to transfer information between devices without any kind of network connectivity it’s been a godsend. Plugging my dashcam footage straight into my phone to play back, music player storage transfer, even light torrenting storage between a laptop and phone.

A low resolution screen. Those saying “at this size it doesn’t matter” are either oblivious or kidding themselves. It’s absolutely noticeable and I can’t stand it. I feel like I’m staring at a cheap laptop display, black pinholes staring back at me.

I feel like I’m the crazy one here, because whenever I search for similar problems, all I can find are reviews giving these devices top marks, singing their praises and patting Samsung on the back for a job well done. Wish I could see what they see.

Edit: one final gripe I had during set up was the finger print sensor. It may have just been getting used to it, or maybe the update the other night improved things, but at one point all four fingerprint scan slots were variations of one thumb, and it still failed to register half the time.

Edit again: seem to be getting complaints/insults about this. Not sure why, this is the experience I am having. Seems I'm not the only one having camera issues on the S21 line.

Either way, it sounds like the camera may have some kind of fault. Many of the replies saying they have the same phone/s and the camera is an incredible upgrade. I'll look into that avenue.

[This is the S21, yes the HDR is better, but detail on the grass is abysmal.](https://preview.redd.it/bi517hui6bg61.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3bf1a6f05de727470c41b011c3ecfe7220043bf)

[This is the S9. Duller, but much clearer and more definition between objects. Compare the grass against the brick wall, or the edges of the bin.](https://preview.redd.it/d15toqri6bg61.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=644348ba73f2ab77234ede5a2b50e17312947047)"
600,"The heat during first set up is kind of normal I'd say with all the process in the background. Sounds like u did a lot of factory reset also.
Give it some time, maybe the phone will act normal without heat or anything. And if not maybe return it"
601,"You will have to block each number they are coming from. Unfortunately not very effective, because they keep changing numbers. Definitely DO NOT text anything back (Stop or whatever), because that just tells them that your number is active."
602,"I can see why Apple are going this route, their chargers provided in the box with the iPhones have always been a joke, but for Samsung to mock Apple, then copy Apple, that's just stupid. I don't know why every company wants to be like Apple or follow their trends, I for one like companies like Samsung, cause they're not Apple, and don't make the majority of the stupid decisions and choices that Apple make."
603,"If you were to point someone to a phone that they could be cheap of the used market, which phone would be a good option to get someone into the samsung ecosystem without having to put forth a large upfront cost? I am think that some S10 model used would be a good choice, but curious to what others think as far as options."
604,"S21 Ultra and Verizon. I keep getting spam texts from email addresses. I've attempted to text ""stop"" ""block"" and swears and nothings worked. Is there a different way to block these? Please let me know. Thanks!"
605,"The case looks very nice and sure they pack a lot of features. I think they are worth 150 USD in my opinion, they came out overpriced. I have the buds+ and they are great too but these things should cost less."
606,"No duh. It has 3x and 10x cameras. Anything greater than 3x zoom and less than 10x will be all digital. 

They added the 3x so that there would be something good between 1x and 10x. In my experience, if 3x isn't best for your zoom shot then the 10x is, and vice versa."
607,"Hi guys, I noticed that when I open the pop-up view on my s21 ultra, the default size of the pop-up window is not always the same, there are 2 sizes,  When I open the pop-up view directly from recent apps, most of the time it has the bigger size, but when I open the pop-up view from dragging down the brief notification, the default size of the pop-up view is much smaller(especially for Telegram). Is it a bug?"
608,"I just got a new S21 Ultra that came with some accessory credit and am looking at the Buds Pro and Plus so I'm not too concerned about the price difference between them, just the features and fit.  The overwhelmingly main use would be for running so fit/comfort matters a lot. Nothing's worse then having to fidget with an earbud during a run.  I've heard some people say the Pros are uncomfortable compared to the plus but I'm really liking the IPX7 rating on the Pros incase it starts raining during a run.  Just looking to see if anyone has any recommendations or experience with these two for running or other exercises. Thanks."
609,"Wow first time ever buying from Samsung online and this happens. I initially preordered the S21 and received it on the 27th. I didn’t like it so repackaged everything they sent me along with buds pro, case and wireless charger, smart tag and packaged it all up. Even took a video of the process. I dropped it off for return the very next day at FedEx. I notice the weight on the scale was around 3lbs when the person weighed it. When I started tracking the shipment however FedEx updated it to 15lbs! Now today I get an email from Samsung saying that my return was unsuccessful and they’re returning my package back to me because the phone was unsent which is ludicrous! I’m so mad right now. This has never happened to me before. I never believed the rumors that FedEx might steal packages but is it possible in this case? I’m not sure how a 3lb package can change to 15lb like that."
610,"I just looked at my invoice online and it says my smart tag was delivered? I got my phone but that was the only thing in the box. 

How did you contact Samsung about your order? I cannot find anything on the site for contacting them. 

The YouTube promo I'm not really worried about. And I'm payng for the Samsung care. My $200 credit is supposed to come later. 

My case will ship the end of the month. 

The tag saying delivered has me concerned."
611,"I have a year old Samsung Tablet S5e - love it. But suddenly some of the streaming services don't want to load. Or they load but I can't get a movie to play.  This has been especially true with Hulu and HBO Max. I reset the apps cache - no luck. I reset the tablet's cache - no luck. I uninstalled the two apps - Hulu seems to be working better now but HBO Max still hangs. 

I hate the idea of doing a factory reset but it looks like that might be my next step.  What does anyone think? Has anyone had a similar issue?

TIA!"
612,"I wish to buy the phone, but there is something I have to know before doing so. My main purpose for upgrade from S8 to S21 5G is eSIM. I travel often and possibility to use local eSIM seems great.

**Is it possible to use main eSIM and random eSIM at the same time, or do I have to use one physical SIM and one eSIM.**

**EDIT: Can I at least have more eSIMs installed at the same time and just switch to which I want active? I do not mind if I am not available 24/7 on both numbers, I just don't want to deal with physically switching cards anymore...** "
613,"Anyone else constantly getting the Google chat features pop up almost every time the text messaging app is opened up on their S21?

If anyone knows how to stop it, please let me know. It doesn't matter if I click use without chat features or agree, I get it popping up again shortly after.

614,I recently just received my S21U. I've went to the galaxy store to try and download some wallpapers. All the ones I've downloaded seem to be a little hazy. I've only been downloading the free ones so that may be the reason why. Is there an app or website I can use to get HD wallpapers for my phone's resolution?
615,"Yea I feel the same way. My mindset has always been to get the lowest capacity phone and just get a 128 gb sd card because they came pretty cheap at 20 bucks, but now that option is gone. Now they expect you to pay up the 50 bucks to get the 256 gb model."
616,"Half of the comments are criticizing OP, wtf?? People are so entitled to an opinion, just cause we can type stuff doesnt make them true OR right. Great for you grandpa, OP! Id love to have a s10e to give to someone else."
617,"yes.  A Play Store app will solve your problem.  Try Autonotification.  There is another app Autoapps that if I remember correctly you need as well.  If you read how to do this on the app, this app works perfectly.  No more wifi calling notification.  Enjoy"
618,I did this upgrade back when the S7+ came out and it was totally worth it for me. I am loving the bigger screen which makes multi-tasking so much better. Honestly though if you aren't as interested in the bigger screen you might as well wait until the Tab S8+ as this is really the biggest factor for upgrading.
619,"I'm selling a pristine iPad 6th Gen for $320, and I was wondering, since a trade in with the Tab S6 puts the price of the Tab S7+ down to $319, is it worth it? My Tab S6 is doing great for me, but I would like the 120hz display, since I have it on my phone and I don't really like the jump from device to device. Should I wait for the Tab S8? Or wait until the Tab S7 is cheaper? Thanks."
620,"Samsung Galaxy A12, Samsung’s newest smartphone between entry-level and mid-range, has been announced. Galaxy A12, which has modest features, resembles a Galaxy M series smartphone rather than the Galaxy A series.

621,"I work in tech as a software tester. 
I bought the Note 20 for its ability to work on it like a mini computer. 

I was able to rename images but I just noticed I can't anymore. 

Did they really remove the option to rename photos?"
622,"Whatsapp seems good, Instagram i didnt notice much of a difference myself. Front facing camera on mine focuses quite slow which i dont remember from my s9+.

So lets say I take a pic with the front facing camera, it literally will take it midfocus so it comes out blurry. Those high MP#s dont seem to do as everyone claims to do. I gotta admit I am disappointed."
623,"Hello all. I've been a Samsung user for a number of years, had the S1 S4 S8+ S9+ and S10. However, I got a bit tired and switched the Huawei, Oneplus and most recently the OPPO Find X2 Pro. BUT I'm back, after the X2 left me disappointed, I've swapped it for this beautiful S21 Ultra. I'm looking for a phone that I can keep for years, I'm hoping this is it.

So, quick question, what are the first things you recommend I do with the phone in terms of settings/installs/customisation. Or just any general good knowledge for where to find useful stuff on the phone.

When I left Samsung, we were on OneUI 1.0, and I'm very used to android so have found most of the main things, but so far, I've not found the setting menu to be super intuitive for me finding those little features that tend to be really nice.

Thanks"
624,"I think the SD 888 is a little better chip all round but exynos is right behind it, in multi core benchmark exynos beats sd 888, but SD 888 has better single core, and with the phones having 8 cores it's better to have a higher single core performance cause less things use all 8 cores"
625,"I've never had a Samsung device before. My current phone is a Pixel, I'm very attached to Google brand, but I needed a new tablet for digital art and after watching many reviews and comparing the S6 Lite was what came out on top as the best option for me. I just set up a $15 a month payment plan on Samsung website for it, and should be here sometime around the 20th-24th according to the website. 

I'm very excited to get to know a new brand.^-^

My main question is: where does Samsung typically ship from in the US? 

Second question: any tips for using Samsung device for someone who is used to the full android experience on Google Pixel devices? 

Third: best case and alternative pen options? I saw a really good pen alternative when watching reviews but it was $100 so that's not viable for me. If you think there's a better option for artists than the s-pen it comes with, let me know. Or tell me why an alt pen isn't needed!"
626,"Well the base S21 cost Samsung nothing to produce especially with the exynos chip, that's why they let them go for so cheap and all the extra discounts

The devices are nowhere near as well built as previous galaxy models, nevermind worth the same price as one.

I can guarantee you won't see the ultra going cheap though."
627,"I recently switched from Apple to Samsung a few days ago and realized that Samsung has become really bad at initial presentations. Big banner advertisements in the stock apps of a $1,400 flagship phone are unacceptable. A $1,400 phone should at least come with promo code for a free charger and headphone dongle if they aren't putting them in the box for environmental reasons. Also, the ""unboxing experience"" was rather bland and missed the attention to detail that Apple products have (i.e. easy to remove shrink wrap). Overall, Samsung needs to get it together in the presentation department if they want to ""wow"" customers on their first impression."
628,"Same dillema here.

From what i have seen, the Exynos performs JUST AS GOOD as the Snapdragon in normal day to day tasks.

The Snapdragon does outperform the Exynos on GPU though.

Overall, the Exynos is still a brilliant SoC. Just that its counterpart is slightly better. 

People out to make the Exynos this year seem like a ripoff (like 990). It's not. Its super good. The gap has closed a lot. Not completely obviously but to the point where either one you get, you're good to go."

631,"Contact help. Tell them your story, with details like where and when you dropped it off.

633,At the same price why not get the newer model its better in several ways even if those benefits are minimal. If you are hardcore microsd person or use that odd Samsung payment thing (forgot its name but s21 dropped it) s20 probably is better but next year's phone will always be better even if the processor is just a little faster.
634,So are people saying they took 2-3 days to get approved or the credits took 2-3 days to get to them after they were approved. Just curious because I've been approved thankfully after 4 days but been waiting for the email for a day lol

637,"Yes it's a good phone. 

From this I suppose you've never used a Samsung phone before? It's different enough that there is a slight learning curve but it's still Android. 

Cameras are fine. Not the best but definitely not the worst. Mid-upper-class.

Pro: has enough flagship features

Con: the touchscreen issues that are still prevalent on some devices. Doesn't matter if you don't game but if you do, you shouldn't be taking the gamble.

Until exynos is far in the lead though and emulation as well becomes prominent I'll be hiding with my imported snapdragon phone. Maybe s23 is for me when AMD has settled in and if its really as good as I hope I'll have to go on a contract with it!! Otherwise... I'll just be disappointed in Samsung."
639,"US models don't get a pre installed screen protector.  I read that Samsung thought it ""confused some customers"" so they didn't include it ??.   I suppose American consumers confuse more easily than consumers elsewhere because Samsung included pre installed screen protectors on the phone in other countries ??

640,"I've had a Note 9 for two years and it hasn't speed down at all. Still works great, minus my battery life decreasing over time.

641,"It feels like Samsung in Germany has NEVER offers anywhere close to that. I see people getting the Phone, Buds, the Tag, The S7+ and a bunch of other shit like cases for almost the same amount of money I'd have to pay for just the Phone (and the Buds / Tag as a preorder bonus)."

I have plenty of data through my phone plan and the phone is showing full bars and LTE, also displaying the name of my provider. If someone could help me out, that would be great!

Edit: under my network modes, 5G isn't even listed, I only see LTE/WCDMA/GSM (auto connect), not the 5G option

652,"I don't know if this post is welcome here, but as far I know, it doesn't go against the rules.
 Now, I don't want to let anyone else down who got the phone, and I may just be me who got a somewhat faulty device,  but my complications with the phone, just get more and more apparent the more I use it. 

I received my s21 about two weeks ago. Just the regular model, since I thought the plastic back didn't bother me, and the only other differences I am aware of, is the size of the battery and the phone itself. I was a bit worried about pre-ordering it at first, because of the exynos chip, but from the videos I saw, it seemed to have improved since last year's phone.

The main problem I have right now is the overheating. I have heard many people complain about the phone overheating from short usage of the camera, and have that problem myself, but that's just one of the many places I find it happening. I find that the regular idle temperature of my phone with all my apps closed, pretty much always is around 40°C. When I wake up, I have found it to be at even higher temperatures maybe 50°. As a note I never charge my phone over night, and close all my apps before going to bed. I do have a bad habit of leaving my phone on my bed or a pillow while sleeping, which heats the fabric up and probably only makes the phone heat up even more. I've never had that happen with any other phone I have owned though, so I didn't think that should be a problem when I got it.

 I'm not concerned about the 'health' of my phone here and now, but when it's constantly reaching those temperatures, even when I'm not using it, I do get concerned about the long term consequences and battery lifespan.

The most annoying thing I have experienced yet, is going to bed with a half charged phone and waking up with a dead one. I missed my alarm and didn't wake up before 10:00am that's not something you would expect from a completely new phone. It only happened once though, but I have woken up several time with less than 15% again with about 50% before going to bed.

I was tempted by the price point, but if the lifespan of the phone won't live up to my expectations, it suddenly doesn't sound like that good of a deal to me anymore.

Anyways, Thanks for listening if you have read this far. If you have the same phone, I hope you're happy with yours and aren't suffering from the same problems I do. I just had to come out with my frustration somehow:)"
653,"For me I charge it when it gets close to 8 or 9 PM just for the sake of convenience, by that time its usually anywhere between 25 and 35% and then gets charged all the way to 100%, and sometimes I charge it at night if it's lasted even longer than I thought."
654,No. I went from S9 to S21U and the only reasons I didn't keep using my S9 was because the battery didn't even last me half a day and the phone was just getting too laggy for daily use. If the phone still ran fine and the battery lasted longer I would've stuck with it.
655,"hello guys!

i just bought a galaxy s21+ about a few weeks ago and am waiting for it to arrive. 

i saw a post earlier about being able to price match a device that is discounted at another retailer.

i bought my s21+ sprint variant thru samsung. i went to request a price match thru samsung.com chat with a best buy link to the exact same phone model and sprint variant, and they say that they do not price match carrier devices.

is this true or is this customer service rep just not playing ball? i don't see why they couldn't price match it, it's the exact same device. i checked the FAQ with no mention of carrier devices being excluded from price matches.

any feedback would be appreciated. thank you!"
656,"Systems analyst here:

There are two points here to consider. Operating system security and hardware security.

While iOS as an operating system is generally more secure than android based operating systems due to the nature of apple being in sole control of the system, android being far more utilised and open source means issues get fixed and patched much sooner.

At a hardware level the two are very similar in how they protect your data. Apple use 'secure enclave' and Samsung uses knox. Both of these are physical chips called a trusted platform module. Both are very secure for almost all uses however, the secure enclave of iphones has been breached several times in the last and samsung has not, at least not to the degree apples has.

Both of these are perfectly fine hardware options and neither is actually insecure.

The take away from this is that iphones are harder to get into when turned on (marginally, if not negligible these days) but if you use samsung knox then even if they get into your device you're still fully protected better than apple even if its negligible.

If you want Windows userbility, go with samsung, just make sure you follow good security measures for your lockscreen and always use knox on any files you want to protect.

Any questions let me know."
657,"I uninstalled a lot of Samsung apps right from the start. The thing that pissed me off is the fact that I can't uninstall Netflix. It's literally baked into the system. I'll never use Netflix on my phone, I never have. But I'm stuck with it anyways. Sure I can disable it, but it's still in there, potentially taking space I could be using for another app."
658,"Every so often i get this message telling me to clean the camera often to get the best picture. 

What's up with this message? I've never seen this on my A30s which was covered with smudges while my S21 is as clean as can be."
659,Yeah there is a delay. Some apps like YouTube and Netflix will delay the video signal so that the audio and video are in sync but a lot of other apps don't have this feature implemented yet unfortunately
660,"The silicone case feels amazing in hand. The feel/lightness of a naked phone is slightly impacted, but is still very manageable with medium/large hands. I was expecting much worse, but its footprint/usage impact imo is not bad in the slightest. I've never had a Note so in regard to the smaller Spen I don't have much of a reference point. That being said, the larger Spen that comes with the case feels great in my hand; and the usability feels very natural."
661,I feel like its a silly question..  My Tab S7 has a 'protect battery' option.  My S21 doesn't... which begged the question for me..  'how often do you charge your phone?   Every night?   'Only when its below n%?  How do you guys handle this question?
662,"Is Samsung this Obtuse in other countries as well or are they just flipping the bird on Sweden? 

So I ordered an S21 Ultra in one of the ""exclusive colors"" and it's just been a mess from there on. 
It doesn't really convey any feeling of reassurance that absolutely no one at Samsung knows exactly what the status of mine or anyone elses phone and order is.
On my order page the status is ""**Order placed**"".
In an email from Samsung on January 27, I received the status ""**Customizing**"", but it still today only says ""**order placed**"" on the order page(!?). And there's several more statuses after this to go through: customization finished, preparing shipping, shipping to your country and at last delivered. 

When I ordered (Jan 14th immediately after the reveal) the shop page said ""ships from the 29th"". This has later been changed to say ships within 4-6 weeks for people who order now.
Samsungs Nordic community manager checked on my order and said that they will start being sent 4-6 weeks **after release** on the 29th (so shipping at the earliest on February 26th). If I ask a Samsung support representative I will get slightly different answers depending on who I ask, something vague about 4-6 weeks and differing between from order date, release date or other.

A bunch of people from UK and France seems to have got their phones on the 3rd and 4th of February, even goodie bags (tripod, water bottles etc.).
Others who have not received theirs yet have at least received ""shipping dates"" and status updates such as ""Preparing shipping"" etc. last week and this week.

How is it possible that a shipping time estimate for a simple phone order can extend through one and a half months? From the 29th of January until the 12th of March. And that it differs wildly depending on who you ask in the organization.

I do not think we as customers here are demanding anything unreasonable, I buy lots of electronics and new phones every year, things like this usually work extraordinarily much better in all other places.
However, I think the simultaneously different order statuses and the highly uncertain and unspecific delivery date for an item that costs 1500EUR is pretty unreasonable.

Never using Samsung shop ever again.

EDIT: Check you order status page now. It seems things have moved for some people just now."
663,"Maybe a factory reset wouldn't be the best option since Samsung's software tries to tailor battery life to your patterns and usage, and if you reset then it'll reset that as well. I know a lot of people notice better battery life given a week or two of it adjusting to each person, but even then it doesn't sound like it will compete with the OnePlus even after the software adjusts to you. I'm not sure how much/if they could improve battery life with software updates, it may just be that 4000mah is just not enough for the hardware it's driving. If nothing else I'd encourage you to maybe give it another week or two and see if it gets a little better as it adapts to your usage"
664,"I was so eager to get the S21 Ultra and I even paid for it. But after reading the complaints on this subreddit and the internet about the ads on Samsung phones, I canceled my order and got refunded. I am not paying $1000+ to get ads. I love Samsung but this is outrageous and totally unacceptable."
665,"I think you're missing the point. Although I personally believe that removing the charger was done for primarily economic reasons, Samsung is mainly referring to reducing electronic waste (i.e. extra chargers polluting the environment), not necessarily packaging. Although, as we see, they have also reduced the size of the packaging.

What they should have done is include a voucher that could be used to purchase a charger if needed by the customer, but we all know that they did this to cut costs. The environment argument is a nice PR excuse they can rely on to look better."
666,"Hey guys!

So I've been lucky enough to get my hands on a PS5. However my problem is that, I wish to set the game mode on my TV (Samsung Q85R) to auto, so it will automatically detect when I'm gaming or watching media content. The option for ""AUTO"" is greyed out, and I can only choose between on or off. I have tried turning off freeSync, I am also currently on the latest firmware and everything is updated. 

I hope some of you guys have solved this problem before or know how to"
667,"Welcome to the Z Fold club!
I also recommend joining us all over at r/GalaxyFold, we’re all great over there!

In terms of your 5 week shipping estimate, did you go for a customised hinge colour? I know this has been an issue with people selecting non-standard colours other than Mystic Bronze and Mystic Black. 

Mine was delivered within 2-3 business days here in the UK, with the Mystic Black colour option."
668,"Probably a dumb question but I've always been a bit old school & never really backed up pictures, other than to an SD card in the phone. Is there even a cloud app built in? Couldn't really find one but I might be missing it."
669,"In my own opinion, I do not miss it whatsoever, I haven't filled much of the 128GB of storage I already have and I barely touched my 1TB SD Card in my S10+ so I'm perfectly fine with this removal on the S21 Ultra, hurts the convenience factor for sure but if I ever do start filling up, there's always a dongle I suppose and I don't mind that. Oh and I almost forgot, Google already does most of the lifting for my photos anyways so I'll be fine."
670,"Hello

I think about a year ago, my Samsung Galaxy A9 2018 stopped giving me any YouTube notifications (except for daily a daily summary). I watched a lot of video's of how to fix this and nothing worked. Battery saving mode is turned OFF and all notification are allowed. How can I turn them back on because I really miss them, they where handy. I'm running Android 10 with One UI 2.0.

Thanks, Milannekuhh"
671,"Have you also tried going to Reddit's settings and toggling ""open web links in-app""?  Mine is set on by default (so it essentially uses Reddit as the browser) but when I toggle it off it does open the link in Chrome without issues."
672,"I'd say this is also slightly invalid now a days, if you want to be that guy ans buy the phone off a carrier and not save any money, but aren't most people on family plans and carrier bound, where there are abundunt deals for new phones?"
673,"For those who have only seen the horror stories, I traded in 2 phones for the s21 and s21 ultra, a s10 that was in good condition and a s7 Edge with screen burn in. Both were accepted today. I believe I have now traded in 4 phones successfully without issue to Samsung. As long as you package your phone well and don't lie about the condition, you shouldn't have any issues. 

I would recommend taking a video or photos of your device before shipping it and make sure you get a drop of receipt in the off chance something happens. I start my video by showing the IMEI/ serial screen and starting that this is a device trade in for the order number Samsung gives, then I show all the functions including charging works. Then I show the front and back glass as well as the camera with any damage. I end the video by showing me selecting the factory reset option."
674,Hi I just got my S21 two days ago and still did not receive anything in the mail regarding finance and how to pay. Only received an email saying that it would be mailed out but that was almost 2-3 weeks ago
675,"Bought myself the new Chromecast recently, and was planning on using it to cast Youtube since the built-in Youtube app on my LG OLED is finicky sometimes. The issue is the picture just looks so much worse on the Chomecast. It's much less vibrant and saturated than on the built-in Youtube app. Yet, I checked the display picture settings and they seem to be the same for the youtube app and the chromecast hdmi input.

Any idea why that would be or what I can do to improve the color on the Chromecast?"

677,"Its not that great at all. My S10 is so slow now a many apps are laggy when opening/closing. Worst of all is the camera, it completely disables the phone for a solid 2 seconds before it opens. And my calculator does not open for some reason."
678,"This is one of the reasons I didn't upgrade from s20 Ultra to S21 Ultra. I didn't pay premium price for a premium device so $amsung can shove ads on my face. For years, people has been speaking about this even in the beta forums but $amsung simply don't give a $hit at this point."
679,"It's clear from the various tests that the Exynos camera performance is noticeably worse than the Snapdragon version.  This is a big deal - the Ultra phone demands its hefty price premium because of the camera performance, and many people preordered based on review videos they'd seen from US based users (with Snapdragon phones). It's not good enough to have really grainy pictures from the top end Samsung."
680,How does the case feel in the hand with phone in it?  Is it heavy?  Does it make the phone uncomfortably wide?  I saw you said it makes the phone hard to take out of the case.  One reason I love my led wallet case for note 20 ultra is how easy it is to remove the phone so when I want to go naked with the phone.
681,"I have come from the s9 + to S21 + and its waaay better. However the fingerprint scanner is a nightmare. Works fine when setting it up and testing but hit and miss in the real world.

I had to turn it off it was doing my head in.

PS love how awesome the new camera is"
682,"I came from a 11 pro max and enjoying this new experience a lot! But I ended up getting the Ultra. Wife is waiting for her S21, coming from a iphone 11 and she's excited after playing around with my phone."
683,"I cracked my s9 screen last month. The main impact is on the right side edge in the middle. It's chipped there with a small black spot that hasn't grown. The cracks extend out from the chips to the top and bottom of the phone. Some times there are ghost touches that so far seem to be manageable but some times they get irritating. But my main concern is, I'm paranoid that the cracks are growing. 

Is there any way to stop them from growing? I heard that adding a screen protector helps but I'm not sure. If anyone thinks it's a good idea then that's the route I'd take."
684,"I went from the X to base S21. .

Loving the switch so far. I never had an Android phone before so everything is new, different and interesting. I like that it has many options to configure my phone. I'm finding new things everyday. 

I honestly like One UI. It's slick, fast and quite pleasing to look at. I prefer it over iOS. 

For your use case, it will be perfect. People say social media is better on iOS but I haven't really seen a difference. I'm a light social media person, more of a browser than a poster, and so far I've had equal experience to iOS. 

2 things i miss from my iPhone:

* Build quality. I think the glass/steel build is a lot better than the aluminium/plastic back. I do prefer the weight of S21 though. 
* battery life - it seems almost the same but maybe slightly worse? I'm not quite sure

Feel free to ask any questions. I'll try my best to answer them"
685,"I'm sorry I can't fully answer this as I have the new trio style pad. But it's the same speed and design so I hope this is at least some insight. Aside from loving the look of it, it gives a nice slow trickle charge so even without a fan it stays cool. Definitely not the type of charger for a quick top up at all but Definitely a good quiet and cool charger for the end of the day. I also have noticed this one must have wider coils than the older ones because I had the dual charger and a lot of mornings I would wake up to an uncharged phone even though it started charging when I set it down for the night. Whereas with the new charger I haven't yet had an issue. Again sorry I couldn't give you insight about this exact charger but I hope I helped."
686,"Note 10 has no headphone jack. Samsung's headphone jacks were only average so it's not like you are missing out. Get an LG if you want a good headphone jack, it has a supposed 600 ohm amp (though I highly doubt that, my estimate is maybe 300 ohms max)"
687,"I have t-mobile. They have a section where you can check on updates. I checked for mine, note 10+, and it said something about ""manufacturer working on it right now"". Im just over here screaming bullshit the manufacturer has had a working build for a while now. I probably has to do something with the carrier is my point"
688,"I mean Samsung put One UI on Android, even though they don't own it. They could put One UI on Windows or Chrome OS, to make it look better. I mean with Windows laptops and Chromebooks, people don't care about the brand. They only buy laptops for their price and value. If Samsung put One UI on it's Galaxy Books and Chromebooks tho, people would buy from Samsung, and have brand loyalty towards them.

689,"I currently have an IPhone 7 Plus. I bought it years ago because AT THAT TIME there was a general consensus that iOS devices are a lot more secure than Androids. I deal with a lot of sensitive financial data of multinational corporations so security was and remains to be top priority for me. The main concern is not remote hacking but physical rooting or access by individuals of the files if the phone is stolen (I do a lot of field work).

Honestly I am tired of iOS. It's not even the price of iPhones, it's the general incompatibility of iOS devices with Windows PCs. However that's a sacrifice I am willing to make if it means that iOS devices are still more secure than Samsungs.

Since it's 2021, I am wondering if the security of Samsung phones are already at par with iPhones. I generally don't care about getting malware from the internet or what because the odds of that happening is very slim. The highest risk in my profession is some thief getting ahold of my phone, bypassing password/PIN and reading all files and messages.

Should I stick with the iPhone or is it already ok to move to Samsung?"

691,"I'm considering getting a new phone in April, and one of my main candidates is the new S21. I have a couple of questions for the people lucky enough to already own one.
1. How's the camera? My number 1 priority is the camera, I take a lot of pictures and videos.
2. How does the battery perform? My main concern comes from a post in another subreddit: The guy who made post complained about how the battery in the S21 drained completely with only 4 1/2 hours from screentime."
692,"You're screwed. 

You'll now be in a boot loop. You'll tell yourself to not think about it but telling yourself that only causes you to think about it even more while you're telling yourself again but to think about it which only causes you to think about it even more.

694,"How far are you from the subject? On the S20U, the Tele lens have pretty far minimum focusing distance and it would constantly use the digital zoom on the main lens, until you hit 10x.  I suspect there's a similar behavior here on the S21U between the 3x and the 10x lens."
695,"The problem for me with the lack of a headphone jack is that when you have a longer gaming session and want to use cable headphones and charge at the same time, it's not possible without a special adapter which I don't trust anyway. Bluetooth Headphones always introduce latency, not ideal for gaming."
696,"I am using the S21 Ultra

1. I have taken pics good enough to look like DSLR shots. It's a hit-and-miss though for photographing people and indoor locations. I would say the latest iPhone series produce more consistently good photos, but of course S21 Ultra beats it in zoom and macro (iPhone don't even have macro)

2. Pretty good. A fully charged phone can last me a full day of use as long as I am not on max brightness and watching movies from morning to night"
697,"Hey I've got a new phone coming and I'm going to be getting rid of my old s10 so I factory reset the phone. However I've been reading mixed messages about just how secure this is to get rid of all the data.

For example I've read a few bits of info online like it doesn't get rid of the data completely or you need to remove your google account before the reset (I didn't) or Samsung newer models encrypt data so I don't need to worry etc..

Really well  polished with its style,  camera zoom functionality , 120hz at 1440p , amazing battery jump, actual competitive exynos processor, and a finger print scanner that works more reliably. 

Also , my note 20 ultra didn't charge my watch well with powershare, was very finicky,  but the s21 ultra charges it much more reliably."
704,"I always remove all the accounts (including other accounts from different apps) before doing a factory reset. Some phones might be locked to the Google account if you don't remove it before resetting. And you'll need to enter the correct Google account password to unlock the phone afterwards, and to sign in using a different account. This is a security feature that prevent unauthorized use of the phone in case it's stolen. So that other people won't be able to use it even after factory resetting the phone.

You can go to your Google account (from another phone or computer), and remove that phone from you account. But it'd be better to check it by setting up the phone again, using a different account, and see if it'll ask you to log in to your previous account to unlock your phone or not."

Samsung has improved in some areas though as they now let disabled apps stay disabled when before said apps could start back up whenever they wanted even though they were disabled meaning you had to buy a package disabler to disable bloatware.

These days Samsung makes life a living hell for anyone trying to use a package disabler app.  They love their ads man.

712,The 5g variant of A52 has been leaked to have 120Hz panel whereas the 4g variant will have 90Hz. That explains why the renders show bigger bezels than A51. Samsung will probably use lesser quality AMOLED to provide those sweet numbers. But still I think it's a great move. Their midrange section needsed this upgrade. A72 is not confirmed to have higher refresh rate. But it obvious that A52's bigger brother will get the same display tech. Now my question is that nowadays you can get S20 FE 4g for 500 dollars or less. And A52 5g's rumored prices are almost the same. So which one would be a better performer for its price? S20 FE or A52 5g?

722,"I see many post and comments here saying how bad of a move it was to remove the SD card and the charger from the box, as if these two are just as bad. 

The removal of the SD card is far worse seeing as there is no replacement possible. That as opposed to the removal of the charger, you can just buy (yes at a cost) a new charger. 

And yes, you can buy external storage (a usb stick works on the S21 just as well) but that's not a useful solution to put in your purse or pocket. 

What do you think?"
723,Hi there I just purchased this sound bar but I found out it doesn’t support LPCM audio. Is this going to be an issue for me since I do a lot of gaming on PS5 and XBOX? I read that when gaming you should keep the consoles audio setting to LPCM but both of my consoles are set to Dolby. Basically just trying to figure out if I’ll have issues with my setup.

I use galaxy s10+ , and I updated my device a week ago. Before I update it, my alarm ringtone was Chime time, but after the update, it changed to Homecoming ringtone.

727,"Hi guys, as you know the new earbuds Pro have ANC however I'm going to be totally honest when u turn on the future it makes basically 0 difference to what I can hear. I'm wondering if my earbuds are faulty or if the ANC is literally that weak to a point where I could have TV volume at 5 and still be able to hear it as if ANC was off? 

The ambient noise feature works great however the ANC is horrible if I rub my fingers against each other even that is audible to a level that it would be if ANC was off any response is appreciated thanks!"
728,"Samsung wouldn't notice or care about that $200. But I'd let them know about it. Huge companies like that don't take losses the way we think they do. They simply jack up the price of next years phone and take away things like headphones, dongles, and chargers."
729,"Keep in mind, the original Fold seemed very much like a prototype vs something more polished- it seems like they've fixed a lot for the Fold2, but that still resells for over $1000 used. I do like the idea of having a tablet-sized screen in your pocket, though!  
I personally don't see the point of the Flip- it's going to be the same size screen as a regular phone, it just folds to be smaller, but chunkier. It's cool tech, but I don't think there's much extra utility there.  
And the foldable screens on these phones, no matter what the marketing says, are essentially plastic, and not anywhere close to the durability of a regular phone screen protected by Gorilla Glass, so you will have to be careful not to get any sand or other hard particles between the folded screen halves."
730,"I just got a Z Fold 2 for my birthday.... Do you still use your Tab S6 like you used to before the Z Fold 2?

731,"I have owned a S8, S9+, S10+, and now a S20+. With the S8 and S9+ I noticed a slight slow down. If I took time and used the system optimizer to put apps to sleep, the slow down was not bad.

I haven't noticed the issue at all with the S10+ or S20+. Possibly the reason is they are not as old as the other phones. Another possibility is the battery/usage optimizer has a better implementation in the newer phones.

For example, my S20+ has three categories in the optimizer: 1) Sleeping apps, 2) Deep sleeping apps, and 3) Never sleeping apps. I can manually add apps to any category. This has allowed me to optimize the background usage based on my usage pattern.

Two culprits of slow down include too many apps running in the background and mismanagement of memory allocation. I have found the memory allocation is better in the newer phones compared to the older ones. In addition, by adding apps to the ""sleeping"" categories I remove the potential for them to run in the background and leave something in memory that wastes space. 

The decay of the drive on the phone is also a potential liability for slowness, but that's a different discussion."
732,"The replacement is them making you pay more for a phone with a higher amount of built in storage. Personally I couldn't care. I used an SD card in my S10+ and never once removed it to transfer data, which I only did through a cable to my Mac. The SD card was nice to beef up the storage but if I can just do that from the outset when I buy the phone in the first place then so be it."

I just read on sammobile that the galaxy book flex 2 is available without 5G (which I don't need) but a 15.6"" display and an MX450 graphics card. I live in Germany. Is it available here?

Internet and social navigation has become a nightmare. Sometimes I click a reddit post and there is no back button, only home. Sometimes swiping up gets me back to the sub, sometimes that just sends me back to the 'desktop.' Sometimes swiping right on social stuff gets me back to where I was and sometimes I end up in a tab from like days ago. There are even times when I am just completely stuck on a page and nothing works. WTF has happened to my phone? Would resetting everything help? Could I have accidentally changed my settings? What happened to having a back button?"
739,"There used to be an Instagram mode for the s10+ which used the actual camera instead of what it usually does. I don't know why they didn't continue with that for the s20.

As for instagram and snap, can't help it. It's out of our hands."

I've seen ones on Amazon that are advertised for iPhones and apple watches that just have you insert the charging ""puck"" into a slot for the watch.

If I were you I would go with s21 since it is more ergonomic(I have big hands). However, the s20 fe's batter is much more superior than s21's. Plus, s21 will get more updates.

I don't even know how water got into it. It makes me think the waterproofing was faulty from day one.

I woke up about 2 hours later and went to grab it and the phone was scorching hot and I was really worried. I didn't know if the phone was going to be damaged because of how incredibly hot it got.

is this normal? i talked with support with the help of google translate and after waiting 2hrs i got the answer that the window for receiving the promo stuff is max 180 DAYS!!!

is this normal? im a student which came here recently and don't know if it is a common thing or if i did something wrong.

also is there a promo or some tricks to get a MOGA controller for my phone ? people in US are getting both the controller and buds and other stuff for free and i can't even get my buds here...

also if any italians reply to this , i want to know if there is a reseller or website that i could oreder s21 from US with promo code and other stuff and ship it here with minimum risk/shipping fee?

759,"As a *consumer* I can easily state why the removal of microSD is TERRIBLE.

**1TB MicroSD $200**. Can be swapped with another card, can be removed from a dead phone, **can be transferred to any other device (like when you upgrade phones).**

**S21U internal** 128GB->512GB **(384GB increase) $180**, cannot be transferred, Samsung gives ZERO additional trade-in value



----

Yes there is more to the story, but in terms of sheer storage and value, MicroSD was king.  

People can argue reliability or speed, thats the consumers fault if they buy a $5 generic microSD card. If the card dies, its no different than your phone dying, you need backups regardless. Cloud is more reliable, but then you have cell data costs, cell data speeds, reoccurring costs ($100/year for 1TB), privacy and security issues, etc.


**Taking away microSD is anti-consumer, and the only reason to do so is to get customers to buy more expensive models with more internal storage.**"
760,Might sound stupid but is the screen on top of the S21 Ultra a removable tempered glass screen? It's making an uncomfortable bump over the sides & camera and was wondering if it is removable before I hack away at it...
761,"I have had the note 9 for the past two years. It's been a great phone, but the battery is failing me now. I was going to upgrade to the note 20 ultra but Verizon hasn't had the 512gb version in stock for quite sometime. 

If you are going to get a really good read on the note 9, then go for it, it's a great phone.

It's explained in [this article](https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-february-security-patch-reportedly-causing-battery-life-issues/amp/?utm_source=telegram).

764,"I bought a S20 Fe 4g few days ago. After I unboxed it and took out the phone, I turned it on. The area near the camera started heating up abnormally. I was still in setup. Going through connecting to a wifi and all that. It kept on increasing for no reason. I opened youtube after the setup. The phone was still hot. YouTube wouldn't open. It kept shutting itself down.

The phone wasn't on 120 hz during this. 

After a few minutes, the phone cooled down and it was fine. It seemed very strange that this happened. I used to own a S8 and this never happened. 

Later I did a factory reset. The phone was so hot it was actually uncomfortable. The screen and the back were really hot. I did factory reset the next day and it heated up just the same 

I went to the same shop I bought it from and gave it back. They sent it to the samsung service centre and they did a QC test and said everything is normal. 

Even now the phone heats up during factory reset. But it's a bit less. I dont know why. 

The phone is warm even when I watch something on youtube or browse on the internet. Which is not really noticeable but still strange for a flagship. 

 Can someone help me with what I should do? I feel like they were just trying to make it take it no matter what."

This mockup shows an S-Pen and I do hope it comes pre-installed, but I do realize this may mean the Note series is laid to rest. If so, the Fold line with the S-Pen installed is the ideal replacement. I kind of wish they made it a tad larger, but that's a hope but I do realize they may mean a price increase of sorts.

770,I pre-ordered for free shit. I was looking to upgrade from my note 9 anyway. $100 off through carrier financing and $200 Samsung credit was enough to make me pull the trigger. I didn't care if I wasn't a day 1 guy. I actually liked having to wait a couple weeks. Game me time to watch and read every review I could get my hands on. Got my S21U a couple days ago.

Has anyone taken advantage of this offer?"
772,"Hi.

I think Samsung showed off on their S21 launch that they made a new API for their camera, that should make the camera work better with third party apps.

I don't see anyone talking about this. What are your experiences with the S21 on social media?  


It's my biggest issue with Android and the strongest feature for iphone imo."
773,I doubt you did anything wrong. It sucks but you may want to do a factory reset in hopes to clear any bad configs. If that doesn't work you may need to think about a replacement. I have the s21 snapdragon and I get around 6hrs sot and easily a full day charge.

775,"The main problem with the S20 ultra's camera was its focusing issue on close up subjects due to its bigger sensor which Samsung solved with a laser focusing system on their next ultra phones.

If you'll rock it with 120hz always then the adaptive refresh rate of the regular S21 is the way to go for good battery life. It's 1440p vs 1080p, and 120hz in S20 ultra is limited to 1080p but people argued 1080p at a 1440p panel is better than 1080p on a 1080p panel."

778,"Not sure this ends well:

 * Dan Evans barely containing ungovernable rage and frustration after about the 2nd point of match
 * Ref gave him soft warning on unsportmanship
 * Lost first set 6-4 due to lack of composure
 * Desperately trying to hold first game of 2nd set, ref calls him for audible
 * Then when Evo pauses to give him the stink eye, calls him for taking too long on serve

A miracle from god came, and Evo held (serve & temper), but I suspect there is a river of rage that will spring to the surface if things don't go well from here."

781,"Kanepi definitely earned that win, but Kenin never looked like herself in this tournament. Even in the first round where she was able to recover and pull out the win, she seemed to be rushing each point trying to win them all quickly, rather than grinding and playing consistently as she usually does, and getting frustrated when she would make mistakes.

It's the epitome of playing the armchair psychologist, but it seems like something personal is going on that's affecting her tennis and I hope she's able to process and overcome whatever is going on so she can get back to playing her best."
782,"Two plausible factors that I can think of -

1 - his body breaks down. He is still so skinny (I painfully relate), and he just doesn't have the body of a fully grown man quite yet. Tennis is a physically brutal sport and...I know how weird this is gonna sound...but I think of the ideal tennis player's body shape as being strong in the backside. Those are powerful muscles, right around the core, and I think of them as the engine room of a strong athlete. Of course this is not a hard and fast rule - there are many exceptions. But if I was going to design a tennis player, I would design someone more like Rafa, Thiem, Stan, Tsonga than someone like Kyrgios, Popyrin, Kokkinakis etc. I think playing 5 sets, or playing week after week, that core power really carries them through. 

2 - certain playstyles are more likely to consistently help a player into the top 60 or so than others, and I think an attacking, big serving style is less helpful in this regard than a solid, consistent style, particularly at the lower levels. Someone like Pablo Andujar for example is able to drop down and dominate challengers on clay if he needs to - his solid, balanced game is just more repeatable and consistent than someone like Popyrin. In order for Popyrin to rise up the rankings he needs a good consistent run of results, and because of his playstyle (fast court player - sets are more likely to be decided by a smaller number of key points), that's always gonna be difficult. If Popyrin drops down to play the hard court challenger circuit he will find himself playing against a lot of players with the ability to make matches tight against him.

Is Pablo Andujar a *better* player than Popyrin...I'm not sure. Is Garin a better player than Herbert? Hard to say...but Garin wont drop out the top 50 for a long time, I predict. He will always be able to get enough wins at clay 250s, or drop down and dominate challengers, whereas for someone like Herbert - who really is immensely skilled - to climb the rankings and stay there would require a few big results, or a really remarkable run of form on the hard courts - which as I say, is tough given his playstyle and the playstyles of the players he is likely to come up against in those tournaments. 

Between those two factors, it is difficult for a skilled but physically slightly frail fast court player to climb the rankings and stay there. 

This is all totally unqualified supposition of course. Just some thoughts that popped up when I considered your question, because I agree, Popyrin's skill level does seem at odds with his ranking."
783,"Being a lefty in and of itself isn't necessarily an advantage, it's the fact that it's relatively rare. Right handed players games are built from playing other right handed players, which sometimes allow them to get by with lesser backhands."
784,"I think this is the best draw for Nadal. Tsitsipas is a great matchup for Nadal, and he avoided Zverev in QF who is a bad matchup. Also, I think people are overrating Medvedev a little bit. He is not as good in AO, and I prefer him to Thiem for Nadal. It's just a better matchup. So I will pick Nadal(if his back injury is more an excuse to rest than an actual injury).

&#x200B;

For the top half, Djokovic is the favorite, but it will depend. If he has to go through Wawrinka-Zverev-Thiem, I think he won't get to the final. If he gets Raonic-Zverev-Thiem I would give him a 50% against Thiem. I will go for Thiem.

&#x200B;

For Nadal-Thiem, I think it's 50-50, but I would favor Thiem because he's getting to Djokovic's levels of clutchness."

That aside, he has plenty of holes in his actual game. 

Just because someone is talented doesn’t mean they *should* be a champion. Mental fortitude is probably THE most important factor in becoming a great tennis player since everyone is pretty much equally talented with some guys being slightly more and others slightly less. 

There are A LOT of players who have more wins over the Big 3 than Kyrgios yet you never see people constantly crying about why they aren’t dominating the sport, lol."
788,"I’d say in some ways Gasquet, Tomic I wouldn’t say is monster talented but he doesn’t make enough use of his talent. Gulbis the same. 

Monster talent & injuries Del Potro, Tsonga to a lesser extent. He’s been injured a lot."

791,"Hi there. Hard to comment based on one video from a bit of an awkward angle so take what I say with a grain of salt (also take what I say with a grain of salt because I’m not qualified to comment ??):

1) I feel as if your right arm doesn’t fully rest in the back scratch position so that you can fully accelerate into the throwing phase - it’s like there is a lack of dynamics in the motion...but super hard to tell. 

2) perhaps there is an opportunity to further coil your upper body - your shoulders pretty much remain perpendicular to the baseline instead of rotating and uncoiling into shot

3) lastly I think your left hand, and consequently the rest of your left side drops too early - maybe try to keep it extended a bit longer?"
792,"Not a Djokovic fan, but Fritz is a mental midget for not closing this one out and needs to stfu. So he’s implying that Novak faked an injury and gave the 3rd and 4th sets away? Even if he did do that, Fritz’ job is to worry about what’s happening on his side of the court, not his opponents."
793,"Lmao, I am Australian and I agree that cheering faults in public is a disgrace. This isn’t European football where the sport is built off tribalism and has only evolved. 

Tennis is a sport which is anything but asides from the national events where you can understand such cheers."
794,"I’m looking forward to AO 1st round match between Sinner and Shapovalov.  It is the second match of the night session which translates to about 5:00 AM Monday on US east coast.   

Argh, checking again Sinner-Shapo will play on Margaret Court while Djokovic-Chardy are playing the late match on Rod Laver.  I’m now hoping that the ESPN gods will be kind to fans of lefties and nextgen players."
795,"He'd also be proud of the farther back return position Sinner adopted after Shapovalov took the 2nd set. It actually reaped rewards and helped him.

Sorry for the members of this sub who keep whinning about it, looks like that tactic might become more commonplace on the tour."
796,"I somehow agree on this, Nick is a grown person who chooses to thrive on chaos. You don’t need someone to tell you how to become a better and respectful person on court. However, Nick could say the same about Novak off court lol"
797,Is anyone here old enough to remember people requesting tennis games to have a challenge system when the game itself is like electronic lines? Lol I've always found it odd that they were essentially requesting for an inaccurate system
798,"**Humbert Uchiyama :** The buzz has slowed but Humbert was one of the best stories from last year. He has made a great improvement on his backhand wing, and his repeatable offense and being a lefty really makes him a pretty heavy favorite here. Uchiyama has some random wins here and there, but struggles to really lock into any event for more than a round or two. The tour is tough. Humbert in 3.

**Cilic Dimitrov :** This is a good one. Sinner Shap is the most unfortunate first round but I think this might be the most entertaining one. Cilc has just been very mundane the past few seasons. Lack of focus, lack of desire, or any other magical factor could be holding him back, or he simply might not be getting enough matches in to compete at his best. He’s still a threat in any situation, and with how often I expect low ranked guys to snag Dimitrov (I thought Popyrin had a chance even though Dimitrov was in good form), I have to give Cilic the benefit of the doubt here.  

This reminds me a bit of the Monfils Ruusuvuori matchup where one guy is clearly playing a lot better, but the other guy has a lengthy match to find his form and can raise big questions marks if the momentum shifts his way. Dimitrov served excellent this past week, and hit his forehand and backhand aggressively and cleanly. These are good signs, but he always seems to struggle to find wins against the easier opponents. Add in that Cilic has beaten him in most of their recent hardcourt meetings, and this is closer to a pickem than anything. Form says Dimitrov, but this is a bundle of nerves against a paper tiger, and it’s very hard to say who will end up in better form despite thinking Dimitrov will have the early edge. Since Cilic actually won a set against Chardy who’s been lights-out, I think he will win a few here also. Cilic in 5.

**Gombos Bolt :** Last year’s Benjamin Bonzi was Norbert Gombos. Sometimes a player really finds their form and notches a ton of wins after struggling for a while. Gombos was that guy. He has a great deal of power, but didn’t look so good against Purcell last week. What’s dangerous for him here is that his “new performer on tour” momentum kinda turns into “must produce results” now, and Bolt is a player in his best form. Alex Bolt has a moustache. He’s got a very accurate and skillful game, and his speed around the court makes him a tough out if you’re not able to break down his backhand. His returning struggled late against Wawrinka, but he served for the match and had ample chances to win it. He’ll enter this matchup as a slight favorite because getting close against a legit contender is usually great for a player’s performance in the following weeks. Gombos will need to turn it around quickly, and even then there is a good chance that Bolt will outwork him. Bolt in 4.

799,"This should not be a round 1 match at all. But to become a champion you need to beat champions. Grande Jannik, continua così e vincerai. 

Jannik's greatest strength is his game management and how he adapts as the game goes on. 

He might be a bit tired so it's gonna be a toss up but I have confidence he can win this."
800,"I'm a bit speechless.

I mean, I remember when Federer said this in 06 and, even with all the context, it was sorta dickish.

But that was 06 when Djokovic was an unproven twerp. And Federer was (is) Federer.

Did Fritz, like, watch Djokovic on the other side of the court? I mean, it was pretty obvious when he was moving side to side that he just wasn't getting to balls as well as usual, if he was getting to them at all. And in the fifth set when he started rallying a bit better, he upped the pace on his shots to either force Fritz into errors or to give him shorter balls. It seemed to be that moving up and down was easier for Djokovic, which is also why he used the drop shot a few times and ran in.

Djokovic finally stabbed at a few returns (I mean, wtf is he supposed to do as the 5th set is coming to a close?) and Fritz made errors. I don't see how you can even conclude Djokovic felt that much better based on a handful of points. Just imagine Rafa in place of Fritz and Djokovic loses that set 6-2 instead."
801,"I know there are some Nadal fans here so I apologize if this offends you. But I just don't see how he wins. Djokovic and Thiem own him on a hard court. Medvedev is about even, that match would be a 50/50 contest if they met, maybe even Medvedev is favoured to win. He also has to contend with his injury.

He would need some sort of miracle where all the good players get knocked out early. What do you think?"
802,"This is great - but it also kinda raises an interesting question. If your coach is babbling, you can get penalized for it (coaching), but you have no capacity to shut them up. So it would make sense for the ump to be able to tell the coach to leave at the player's request, right?"
803,"For crying out loud they’ve all been playing tennis for years and years.  A couple weeks down time while still working out in the room should not play one iota into a loss.

He’ll work harder and harder, and he’ll be on top in a few years."

810,The fact Sinner was able to take this to a deciding 5th set despite running on fumes from consecutive days of match play is super impressive. Good win for Shapo but I am more impressed with Sinner's potential.
811,"In terms of his comments about other players, I personally don't see a need for results as a way to validate those opinions. He says what he wants and I'm pretty fine with that. I know a lot of people what tennis to be this fantasy world where everyone is super nice to each other in public, but I don't care about that too much. Idm a bit of drama especially when it's still relatively tame in tennis overall, and doesn't overshadow what is most important, which is the tennis. I also think Nick can say whatever he wants and his results shouldn't impact how those comments are perceived. You could say Boris Becker has had enough success to speak his mind, but I think he's one of the biggest idiots in tennis and find the majority of his opinions to be really stupid. Nick can also be an idiot ofc, but whether he's been a successful player or not shouldn't really influence that perception at all. And as for why he's still talked about heavily in the media, I think the answer is obvious. He's painfully outspoken in a sport where that isn't particularly common, and he has a flashy game style that makes it easy for media to describe as ""raw talent"", even though talent in tennis is about way more than trick shots and hand skills lol. But in general, we've always correlated talent with aggressive, flashy play, and while I think that notion isn't correct, I don't see that changing anytime soon.

As far as Kyrgios as a player is concerned, he's pretty good. But he also has a lot of holes in his game. People like to use the lazy narrative that he's a a top talent with a bad mentality and lack of work ethic that holds him back from great success. I'm sure there is some truth to that but I've seen Kyrgios lose a lost of tennis matches because of tennis reasons, not because of his fragile mind or lack of fitness (although lack of fitness is a big reason for him not being able to string together some good results without having a niggling injury). Honestly, Kyrgios may have his on-court antics and constant commentary but he generally brings a decent level to the court overall, and he usually shows up to ""big"" matches and plays some good stuff. The reason he loses those matches is usually because of shoddy returning, sometimes poor shot selection and a backhand that is situationally useful but a big liability against certain players. You could argue he could patch up these flaws more effectively if he was more committed, but as it stands, he is far from the perfect player even if you completely disregard his mentality and commitment to the sport. IMO, if you gave current Nick Kyrgios a much healthier mentality and stuck this version of him into a grand slam, I still don't think his chances of winning it are particularly high. Kyrgios on a good day can beat anybody IMO, but that's not something unique to him, and he still has a lot of flaws in his game that stop him from making a deep run in a big tournament. I still have some hope for him just purely because his serv"

815,"Kyrgios is incredibly talented but simply does not play a style of tennis conducive to winning at the highest level.  He takes far too many risks in his game.  This is exactly why so many people like him.  Tennis is not a game that rewards taking risks.  He is more interesting to watch than just about any other major player and the reason he is more interesting is the same reason he does not win more often.

I think he certainly could win more often and win major tournaments if he stopped taking so many risks with his game, but that would also make him a lot more boring and less fun to watch."

823,"Thiem showed the mental fortitude of a true champion in this match.

It felt a bit like a Djokovic match to me. Came out a bit slow, a lot of times in the 1st two sets he bailed out of points just slapping the ball completely flat.

Then just that one tiny moment in the 3rd set, when Kyrgios blew the break point to really put the match on ice, and then Thiem gets the break, and it you can just feel the tide turn.

On top of the crowd and the crazy momentum shift, there was also some very high level tennis in the last 3 sets.

Some huge points, including match point, were decided by brilliant shots and great points.

Lovely to watch. And glad Thiem won."
824,"Although the two-year ranking provides protection from injury, I think 1 year is far better. Tennis ""form"" is much more volatile and we've seen players do well one year and completely drop off the next year. One year ranking is a better indicator of current form and realistically I think is a better indicator of how a player will do in a tournament, which is important for seeding purposes."

832,"Big apologies for the late posts as I am struggling a bit with the Australian sleep schedule and woke up late today.  Posting the first wave of WTA matches here and will edit in the others before these first matches are done.  Update : All the matches are up.  First few are based on the schedule, rest are via the draw format 

 **Andreescu Hsieh :** Andreescu looked engaged and crisp in her debut, and then the problems came. They always did in the past, as Andreescu struggled to maintain consistency and generally had to turn it up in the third sets of matches. Here though it looked more like rust, and there were a few points in the 3rd set that had they not gone her way she may have lost. Enter Hsieh, who was dominant against Pironkova. She simply was the perfect opponent to beat Pironkova, combining defense with keeping the ball low and capitalizing on her movement to really outlast one of the better baseliners on tour right now. Counterpunching is Pironkova’s thing and Hsieh doesn’t give you much to work with in that sense. It’s hard to say whether Andreescu shrugs off her rust between rounds, and whether those errors come if she forces the issue against Hsieh. This is a really difficult test though, and Hsieh beating Pironkova puts her at this level for this match. If Andreescu can clear this hurdle, she’ll look good for a deep run in the event. It’s going to be a big if though, as Buzarnescu isn’t really a dominant player and Bianca was lucky to get through there. Hsieh in 3.

**Cornet Li :** Cornet had a war with Valerie Savinykh, and Ann Li, well, she just isn’t having any wars right now. Li was the most improved player by far in the off-season, and she showed it last week. Cornet is the ultimate test of an offensive baseliner, and she will outlast you if you make errors. This is a great match because we get to see if Li is legit, but my guess is that she is. She plays very offensive tennis, and beating Jenn Brady is no easy feat. Li in 2.

**Potapova Babos :** Great win for both players really. Potapova got a good break with Riske being extremely rusty, and Babos put the work in to beat Bonaventure. This is a brand new matchup, and I do suspect that Babos has an edge here. She’s played a lot more matches in the past few weeks and has been very focused and competing hard. That breeds results at some point, and she should be able to win this. Babos in 3.

**Sabalenka Kasatkina :** Everytime anyone watches Sabalenka play tennis, “she’s going to win the whole tournament” comes to mind. No one else hits the ball like her. No one. No one else plays as much offense, and yet she finds ways to lose. Something must be in the pizza I’m eating, because I think they’ll struggle here. She’s beaten Kasatkina without much struggle in the past, and it has always been a good offense vs defense test. Kasatkina has been making steady improvements though, and Sabalenka has had a long stretch here without a real letdown. Even as I’m writing this I’m aware it’s "

Next thing I know he was losing when he should have been wining. Tomic should challenge these results. He has every right to use every legal mechanism known to humankind to protest the results of the Australian Open. And even then, we will still never know who actually won! Widespread evidence of major fraud! Sad!"
834,"Hard to say. Serena is the only one of those players even remotely close enough to her prime to make a comparison today. And while the younger generation have got the better of her a few times recently it's not because Serena lacks pace on her shots.

In the women's game in general (not just top players) I think the power has stepped up. You've got way more players throughout the top 50/100 who on their day can go toe to toe with top players. They can be inconsistent though.

Also courts are generally playing slower today than 20 years ago so players are maybe forced to hit harder to get on top of points and hit winners."

It was common for me to be playing with taped and super glued hand because that’s how bruised my hand was but I was addicted. 

Next you’re going to break strings a lot. I was breaking rpm in 2-3 days or about 6-8 hours of play they would just snap. If you watch him practice everyday I’d say for a year and practice you’ll get a somewhat adapted version of his forehand.

At the same time, these are all rituals he does to make himself feel familiar in so many different playing environments.

Imagine you're traveling all over the world, playing thousands of matches over many years. It makes sense that you'd repeat certain things to make yourself feel at home where you are. (If you've played tennis when you feel uneasy, you'll know how bad you play. And obviously Rafa is devoted to excellence.)

Ultimately Rafa has a good heart. He's competitive, but he isn't mean spirited toward anyone. That's why he was able to smile to himself when the lady in the crowd started drunk rambling on him."

Lefties (most likely) grow up training and practicing against righties, so they are accustomed to dealing with righties.

If most tennis players were lefties, then righties would have the advantage."

He's far closer to Raonic than Federer, Shapo, or any other players this sub loves to watch. 90% of the time Kyrgios plays like a typical servebot with a dumpy return and weak backhand. Most matches with Kyrgios are a snoozefest from start to finish but as I said he rarely disappoints in creating a few amusing points for the highlight reel."

This was a scheduling issue, which they seemingly could have resolved by playing two matches in one day for the quarterfinals. They had already changed the rules mid-tournament to shorten the matches by making the 3rd set a 10-point tiebreak, so this would have been in agreement with that idea. Yes, this is a unique situation and it is just a made-up warm-up tournament before a grand slam, but it's still an official 500-level tournament with prize money and points awarded. If they were this willing to play fast and loose with the rules, maybe they should have made it an exhibition in the first place? I guess many will say this doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, but it's still pretty unprecedented and I think it puts WTA in a bad light. 

Also after winning her semifinal Kontaveit stated that players were not consulted about this decision and that she would have liked to play the final. The other semifinalist was newcomer Ann Li, who played great tennis all week and had a breakthrough run to her first WTA final. It's unfortunate that she won't get a chance to play for the biggest title of her career."
845,"If you’re a tennis fan you should be thankful the media does talk about him. Judgement aside, good or bad, this guy gets tennis into the spotlight. Probably the only player other than the big 3 that actually brings attention to tennis. So regardless if you like him or not, on or off the court, him bringing attention to tennis honestly helps the sport either way"
846,"Lovely.

Once Thiem reined in his errors, Kyrgios and his serve-botting stood no chance. 

The match was always on Thiem's racquet, no matter what Kyrgios and his deluded assholish fans who think he's the be all and end all of talent in tennis think. 

He's an overrated turd and it makes me happy knowing the 2 cuntiest countries- Australia & US won't be having any (male) GS champions for a while.

One idiot country thinks having a serve and nothing else is the key to tennis.
The other idiot country thinks trick shots and big serves= talent and titles. Happy to see both continuously been proven wrong.

SUFFER, lmao."
847,Who are the tennis players you root against because you do not believe they are great people because of some scandal you heard about or something they did in the past? Just curious to find that out. Thanks. Would like to know who to root against.
848,"I don’t think he would have turned the big 4 into big 5 in that 2009-2013 period, but he would have caused a fair number of upsets. He still had an overwhelming losing record against Fed et al and I don’t think that would have changed much. On his day he could beat anybody, but that doesn’t mean he could have done it consistently. He might have won another major or two, and maybe picked up a couple masters, but I don’t think he would have had that dramatic of an impact on overall winner results had he stayed healthy."
849,"She speaks out! https://au.sports.yahoo.com/australian-open-2021-spectator-speaks-rafa-nadal-incident-011306801.html

> ""I’m certainly not a fan of Nadal, I think he’s boring and he goes through all those OCD rituals all the time,” she told Neil Mitchell on 3AW radio.

> “I just called out, ‘Get over your OCD rituals’ as he was serving, and then he looked at me, and that’s when I flicked him the bird.

> “My daughter wasn’t too happy because I’m so embarrassing. I was going for the other guy actually because so many people seem to go for Nadal.”

Not all heroes wear capes."
850,Sinner is taller than what is currently listed on the ATP website. He’s grown a fair bit I’d say. The ATP only measure a player when they turn pro for their profile page. These stats don’t get updated.
851,"WTA: Anisimova has a great talent but idk if instagramming is more of a priority to her. She seems to be posting a lot of practice videos on it tho, but idk, I always wear my trackies and trainers everyday and take a selfie pretending I went out for a run, idk. Her BH DTL return is beautiful."
852,"It's another early exit from a major for NK. You can take the information, digest it, and no matter how you package what comes out the other end, NK did as well as you might expect someone in the 50-100 range to do.

A 5 set loss to DT in the grand scheme of things means nothing.

He is a top 5 entertaining social media abuser and shit talker tho, right up there with the Kardasians and Jake and Logan paul...so...."
853,"Travaglia pre underrated atm. 4.00 odds against Sinner? dude has beat 3 top 10 seeds so far and is having such a good run on the hard court recently. Definately could cause an upset. Sinner has had to play so much on top of doubles, how is he not fatigued?"
854,If he plays out of his mind and Thiem has a really bad day then maybe. His knee has been giving him issues and after playing a 5 setter last round I don't think he'll be in good enough shape to take on Thiem.
855,"I typically hate how Shapo plays doubles in slams, but considering Tomic doesn't even look interested in making him break a sweat, Im glad he has a doubles match scheduled prior to the 3R vs FAA, just for tune-up purposes."
856,"Every time someone tries to convince the group the NK is somehow fixing things and he's on the rise they always say something like this:

 "" We’ve all seen what Nick can do when he’s ‘on’. Now imagine what he could do when that’s backed up with decent training over consecutive months. ""

Has he ever broken the top 10? Has he ever made it to the second week of a major? Yes, he's 2-0 vs Joker.  

At his best he's barely a noteworthy player, results-wise.  He just has a big mouth, a bad attitude, and the mental strength of a toddler. 

He's 25 and he looks soft, prolly 10lbs over weight. Get ready for the second half of his career to be even less compelling that the first.

People really don't often change as an adult. He is who he is. Stop glamorizing his mediocre past to prop up his future."
857,i love demon heaps and i want to give him praise for this but like... was that a speed gun error? he's a pretty small guy and doesn't usually have the most powerful serves. the serve in question was actually returned by sandgren and went on to be a short rally. just doesn't seem like it really was a 228 km/hr serve tbh
858,"It's only really for the finalists and semifinalists of the prior tournament that the tiredness carries through. Most people end up not facing the issue at all. 2-3 days rest before the slam, some warm-up, some money is all in all a good deal."
859,"This is how things go mainstream. Only die hard fans know every details, what is right and what isn’t. That cover is creepy tho, I bet it will get clicks from regular people who know nothing about what happened."
860,"I'll shut up about Medvedev soon, but he's perhaps the peak example for us amateurs to play the ball and not the stroke. His form is absolutely fucking wonky sometimes (often?) but he'll still place the ball to perfection.  

&nbsp; 

Meanwhile, I still play tennis in such a way that *if* the papparazzi are lurking and snap a photo, I'll always look like Roger circa 2006 even if the ball never goes in the court"
861,I don’t think it will happen. If it was a two year system a winner of a tournament would have little reason to play it the next year and would decrease competitiveness at all tournaments. You could have a situation where nadal and djokovic are just alternating years of winning but never playing each other.
862,"The rhythm of play is much better with electronic line calling. No players pausing to stare at the line, no interruptions due to challenges. It makes a big difference over the course of the whole match."
863,"shapo needs help ASAP. he played with no confidence at all, and started having a meltdown during the match, telling the crowd to shut up, his now constant screaming... go back to smaller tournaments, back to basics, learn to win and be consistent, and learn to deal with pressure."
864,"When he came on to the pro circuit it was the two special K’s (Kokk and Kyrgios) bursting on to the scene at the same time. 

Sad to see two young players with such promise have such different starts to their career, but hopefully Kokk starts to do well now and it helps to motivate Kyrgios too!"
865,"Hit more shots in than they do. In all seriousness, just go play your game and have fun don't focus on the score, try and focus on each point. Have fun, tennis is supposed to be fun. There will always be someone better and someone worse than you, just make it enjoyable."
866,"The other two are great players, winning machines. But Roger Federer is a genius. Mozart with a racquet. 

It's similar to something like skateboarding, 100 different people can do a 360 flip but there's that one guy who does it and everyone can see it's clearly more beautiful, smooth, effortless and you think, ""that's how it should be done."" 

Some people will hate it of course, many because of how others love it. But 9 out of 10 folks see Roger play and go, ""yeah, that's how it should be done.""

See also; Ronnie O'Sullivan."
867,"You can't change the schedule over 1 player. They put out the schedule on Saturday and put him on as late as possible today. Could've easily withdrawn like Naomi, Serena, Vika or Stan, but he chose to play. 

He'll be good for the long run, but you can't blame the organisers for him winning the tournament last week."
868,"There's been a ton of posts about Nick Kyrgios lately. He's extremely polarizing but I saw another post asking if he was the most overrated player in history, as he has never even made a slam semifinal. I think he theoretically has the talent to be a contender for a major, like Wimbledon, but he seems to be far from reaching his maximum potential and it's unclear if he's even moving toward reaching his incredibly high ceiling. Anyway here is a list of players that have made the Quarterfinals of a slam since Nick's last appearance, listed in the order of their most recent appearance, with the amount of quarter-finals they have appeared in in parenthesis.

869,Tourneytopia unfortunately doesn't have one. You guys can also use this one which has a more standard draw format: [https://www.globaltennisnetwork.com/tennis-tournaments/bracket-challenges/bracket-challenge-page/searchPlayers/1261-men-s-australian-open-2021](https://www.globaltennisnetwork.com/tennis-tournaments/bracket-challenges/bracket-challenge-page/searchPlayers/1261-men-s-australian-open-2021) sorry about the late notice / help!
870,"I don't think Djokovic fakes his injuries. I'm sure he would have preferred to finish the match in straights and go to bed earlier, as he's done many times.

However, he does show his physical frustrations more than most players, especially Fed and Rafa (he's not necessarily wrong to do this). If an injury is bothering him he will shout at his box, touch the injured area and generally look completely dejected. These emotions may be genuine but they make it seem as though he is completely finished even when he's not. He seems to be a player who needs to express his difficulties before he moves past them and, when he does, he usually wins.

But hey this is just speculation, we can't actually know for sure what he's really feeling on court."
871,"I saw in Twitter that in the men's side 7 hard quaratiners lost with 2 winning...  and both the winners were playing other hard quaratiners. So very clear effect on the men's side.


In the women's it was 5 losers 5 winners so maybe no affect there.

Edit: actually the 2-7 count was part way though day 1, the final count for day 1 according to [this](https://twitter.com/TennisPodcast/status/1359018652952113153?s=20) 2-12. Would love to get a full list of hard quaratiners though."
872,"Some Twitter folks saying that Fognini called Caruso ""lucky"" on a couple of points and Caruso took offense to it at the net. Fognini was chirping back at him saying ""you did get lucky, how come I can't say that?"" 

Long live Italy"
873,"Poor Caruso doesn't deserve this crap. Fognini is supposed to be a leader for Italian tennis, not tear into lower ranked players when things don't go his way. Caruso would have had a better chance against De Minaur too."
874,Can we not announce these things? Maybe put a spoiler alert so that you only see the results if you click on it? I keep forgetting that I can’t go on Reddit whenever there’s a tournament. Some of us haven’t watched yet!
875,"Over the last year the YouTube channels of the Slams have taken to uploading full matches of certain matches with high entertainment quality. The US Open and Australian Open channels are more generous with their uploads, Wimbledon and the French, not so much. If we're lucky, Sinner vs Shapo will be one of the matches uploaded after the tournament ends."
876,"Anyone else think the man is absolutely on fire? Beat the top 3 players to win the ATP finals, looking really good this year, hasn't lost a match in the ATP Cup as of now. Playing incredibly well. I think he could win the Australian or US Open this year. Obviously never easy going against Nadal, Djokovic, or Thiem, but he's got the tools to beat them"
877,"For me the most frustrating part about watching Shapovalov's game is that there are such obvious areas of improvement. Shot selection, double faults, having a slice. Whenever he comes up against a consistent baseliner like this, he gets exposed."
878,"We've got a pretty big sample size on how Delpo matches up against Murray/Nadal/Federer/Djokovic, which on the face of it suggests he would've been picking up the scraps of the big 3 and getting a big victory over one of them now and again. As to how he would've fared with Murray, their head to head would have likely levelled out more.

The most fascinating aspect of the Delpo 'what if?' is the timing of his breakthrough in 2009. At that juncture, Djokovic's self belief was on the decline, Murray's grand slam threat had cooled off(one slam QF and one SF), Nadal was recovering from injury, and Federer was on his way to a post-AO slump. So what edge would Del Potro have gained in the mental stakes had he continued his form and taken one of the AO/Wimbledon/USO, beating Djokovic or Murray along the way? Keep in mind that Djokovic considered retirement in 2010([https://www.ubitennis.net/2020/04/novak-djokovic-thought-retiring-sport-2010-losing-jurgen-melzer-roland-garros/](https://www.ubitennis.net/2020/04/novak-djokovic-thought-retiring-sport-2010-losing-jurgen-melzer-roland-garros/)) and Murray suffered his own crisis of confidence after losing in the AO final, failing to recover his form until the grasscourt season.

It's highly possible Delpo could've established himself as the world number 2 at the end of 2010, leaving Murray and Djokovic in his wake, and maybe kicked on to the top spot in 2011 when Nadal's form dropped somewhat. Federer's strong head to head against the Argentinian doesn't tell the whole story about Fed's estimation of Delpo as one of his biggest rivals, and if the post-USO momentum against Federer had been maintained then Del Potro might have posed a bigger challenge against him in significant matches.

Mental battles have played such a big role in the big 3's rivalries, and Delpo looked like he was on the way to asserting his status as a formidable opponent between the lines and between the ears. But even if he had won more slams and improved his head to head against everyone, I think his success would have been intermittent and I don't see him holding onto #1 as long as Nadal/Federer/Djokovic have. His reliance on his weapons and his lesser mobility would have continued to be an issue getting in the way of any sustained dominance."
879,"Looks like a great serve to me. Obviously alot of work put in there, well done ??

One thing I noticed some pros doing which I'd sure like to pick up is the recovery after the serve. It looked like if they liked the serve result they pushed deeper into the court, if not they bounced back behind the baseline using the foot they landed on. Seemed to give them an advantage either attacking or defending after the serve is returned."
880,"Thanks for the writeup, I missed the match due to sleep ??

Consensus seems to be that Sinner was fatigued, which I don't blame him. On paper, I was expecting Sinner to win so I'm pleasantly surprised to see Denis pull through with a strong performance on his part. That was a terrible R1 matchup for both.

I'm not worried about Sinner. Winning the tournament the week before is probably more important in the long run, and after covid protected rankings is over, Sinner's rank will shoot up rapidly."
881,"I think it’s pretty clear that Delpo has the firepower to stand up to absolutely anybody on the tour. That coupled with the fact that even from a young age, he had the composure/mentality to win slams...it’s hard not to speculate that he would have been a major force in the 2010s, potentially could have taken 4-5 slams."
882,"He is taking this, Djoko doesn't have what it takes this year.  And obviously everyone else isn't even close.  Prepare for a landmark year if Rafa keeps healthy.

He is playing with high confidence and brushing everyone off.  There is no competition for him here lmao.  The only fun matchup for him is Rogie now because of unique style you can tell everything else is so benign to him he just dusts them immediately.

That being said I think a fun matchup could be Shapo and Rafa as Shapo on a perfect day can give some opposition to him.  Might actually be able to push 5 sets.

Thoughts?"
883,"For football, nfl, nba, baseball there are plenty of websited where you can find good highlights but for tennis there is literally tennis tv which you have to PAY. Tennis tv on youtube only uploads 2-6 mins highlights from 3 hour matches. Thats so weird. Why is this?"
884,"It's kinda funny to watch the ""certain part of the world"" squirm, twist, squeal, bit\*ch, cry, lie, libel, etc... UNITED... in one, sole purpose: 

Diminish Novak Djokovic and the fact that Novak Djokovic (Serbian) is the GOAT of tennis and one of the, if not THE, Greatest athlete of the world's history. 

He's not a Brit (athough they sucked his di\*ck to take their passport), he's not american or german or french... He's just a Serbian kid (like so many other kids like him in Serbia) that CRUSHED the myths about certain ""superiority"". 

I'm enjoying it."
885,"Rows are a great way to increase strength in your shoulder.  The row strengthens the your scapular stabilizers (muscles around shoulder) to help prevent injury, promote good posture and increase your strength.  Many shoulder related injuries stem from shoulder muscles imbalance.  The row is a great way to prevent this.

In this video I demonstrate 3 ways you can perform a row using resistance bands. Every tennis player should have them. 

[https://youtu.be/Fu3-rdYIsyE](https://youtu.be/Fu3-rdYIsyE)"
886,"Such poor sportsmanship to start an argument after the match is done. When a game of any sport is finished you shake hands with your opponent and move on, you don't start a fight as you're walking off."
887,"Couple of things not mentioned, which are absolutely crucial to replicate the forehand.

Stance:

Rafas buggy whip forehand is typically hit with a semi-open or even completely open stance. Both of these (the latter especially) are seen as more defensive stances, often used when you don’t fully have time to get your legs set. 

As a by product of these stances, it’s quite difficult to put a lot of forward pressure on the ball (i.e flattening it out), since the natural contact point for those is more parallel to the body as opposed to out in front of you, resulting in a more vertical motion = topspin!


Arm strength:


It’s no secret that Rafa has some guns on him, and this is a big part of the reason he can produce such a powerful ball in what is typically a defensive stance. Getting your legs involved to produce power in extremely difficult the more open your stance is, so having the arms compensate for that is an absolute must. 


Grip:

Something which I for sure would have thought to see here is that Nadal’s grip is super odd. Not insofar as to how he orientates his hand (it’s a semi-western), but how low he holds his racket.

If you google pictures of his forehand in motion you can see that his pinky is almost off the racket! This serves the purpose that his wrist is allowed to further snap back during the motion, creating even more torque on the swing, and allowing him to REALLY rip it. Coupling that with a super loose wrist anyway and his racket-lag on the forehand is truly absurd. 


Hope that clears a few things up."
888,"Theres a local guy who plays double handed off both wings; he's around 40 now and still plays state league. UTR around 10 - but, even at his best, I don't think he he wouldve been around a 800 in the world player and nothing more.

Don't get me wrong, he's tough to play - and its not easy to jam him, and he's still good good control when forced to take a hand off and slice - but, whether it was his style, or just him, there was a definite limit to his best level of tennis."
889,"I think one of the bigger problems with this is that line judges were part of the pipeline for chair umpires. Not sure how that will work long-term now.

And of course line judges will still be needed on clay since Hawkeye isn't as accurate there."
890,"Man, Hsieh was constantly hitting that baseline and with all the balls she retrieved, it looked as though she half-vollied all the baseline balls, compounded with Bianca's shanks it's no wonder she won."
891,"He's got a punchers chance vs anyone.

Its gonna depend a lot on nicks serving. If he can keep the points short and thiem plays as loose as he did at RG and at the exho vs nadal, he will have his chances 

With home court advantage , I think he will have a ~30% chance."
892,Does anybody know why Argentina vs. Japan wasn't played yesterday? I get that they couldn't have made it through to the semi finals but it just seems weird to have group stage matches after semi finals. Maybe a late covid test result delayed it?
893,"Hi!  A ton of great tennis in this third round.  About half the women's matches are here, and I'll edit in the rest in about 20 minutes.  Thanks to those of you that have participated in our picking contest [AO CONTEST DOT TURTLE DOT COM](https://degensclub.com/competitions/ao-tipping-competition/events)No thanks to those of you that are currently beating me though.  Please make some errors today thank you <3

Update : All matches are here now 

**Djokovic Fritz :** Novak played one of his trademark strange unexplainable trying-to-lose performances against Tiafoe. He was passive, he made rally ball errors, and he struggled with the heat. He seemed to have minor neck stiffness, and just overall was not at his best. Once the sun went down though, he coasted. This was a good match for Tiafoe but after seeing previous comments after losing to a top player like “I had you bro”, I’m not sure he’ll get the right takeaways here. If we look at the positives first, Tiafoe served great in this. He hit a number of very effective second serves out wide and hit his serves harder than he generally does without a huge variation in % that landed in ze box. He got slice-happy for a good chunk of time, but he hit his backhand in the court and used the angles available to pressure Novak when he had control. Of course, this doesn’t produce points against he best backhand in tennis, but it does against everyone else on tour. If Tiafoe stays committed to keeping the ball on the court, then instead of him tiring out it will be his opponents. The forehand is still a very easy shot to miss low if his footwork isn’t there, but footwork is 75% conditioning and 25% mental focus. The closer he gets to these kinds of results that he wants, the more he will work harder in earlier less interesting clashes to get to the good stuff. The smart child eats their vegetables first so they can get to mom’s fancy chicken. Or mom’s fancy tofu, I see you vegemarians.

The downsides are what made me think Tiafoe had no chance even though he had a chance. In a 3 out of 5 match, there are going to be highs and lows. Djokovic was struggling, was extremely subdued, and looked frustrated. When someone isn’t engaged in the match like that, be like a burglar. Quietly do the work and don’t celebrate. This isn’t what fans want to see, and I also laughed a bit seeing Tiafoe get hyped after winning the second set, but screaming “I love this shit” and immediately nodding like he expected the result all along, is a wild reaction to winning a single set, and slapping your chest and celebrating a single set just kinda shows that you are winning battles while having no real intentions towards the war. The errors came, and despite Novak playing some amazing shots, Tiafoe devolves quickly into shaking his head as if he cannot possibly believe how good his opponents are playing. This obviously goes against his nature. Tiafoe is a happy dude. He loves to play in these big moments, and he believes in himself so"
894,"It seems to me pro tennis has found itself in something of a quagmire in this regard - it isn't easy to see how they seamlessly go back to a one year ranking any time soon, and I must say - I don't really see much downside of keeping the two year ranking indefinitely. It offers much more protection from injury and fatigue and would arguably be more representative of consistency and 'quality' and less on 'form' - which in a sport as capricious as tennis could really lighten the mental burden on the players. 

The obvious downside I can see is the lack of drastic and immediate reward for a big result - but imo that would be more than balanced by keeping those points against one's names for longer. 

It could also be possible to maintain both rankings - for example the Tour Finals spots could (and should) still be decided by the one year ranking, but entry into tournaments by the two year.

I am a big snooker fan, and snooker has operated with a two year ranking system for years. It works fine imo.

I have a feeling this idea will be unpopular though. If you can't wait for the one year ranking to be reinstated, is there a factor I'm missing which makes you feel this way?"
895,Todd Woodbridge over at the Australian commentary all but confirmed that the replays showed that the ball did not hit the net. Something along the lines of 'the ball did not go over the net as far as Kyrgios suggested'.
896,"Not particularly a Gauff fan, don't love her game, but she's fucking 16. Players almost never break through at that age anymore. Of course she's going to get attention when she's at an age where most players are playing junior events and she's winning rounds at grand slams. 

But sure, it's because she's black and American."
897,"I think it’s a combination of things. 

I think first, he’s aging. And his style of play is so athletic, I wonder if he’s feeling his age in that department. Im sure he has a lot more to give, but I think it’s affecting his mental game a lot. 

Second, Covid affects people differently. I’d wager it’s affected him disproportionately bad. 

Third, social media has been brutal against him. I know it’s easy to say, “he shouldn’t care what they say” but again, that’s easier said than done

I think ultimately he’s in a rut, and it’s showing with how he’s handling himself. Maybe a sports psychologist may help, but again, idk really. 

I hope he comes back to full force."
898,"What’s it with Thiem getting smacked in the first 2 sets to drag himself back for 5? ??

I’m happy for both players here, Nick’s provided he’s still that amazing guy on the court I love & Thiem demonstrated his mental strength to handle the crowd and moment and prove he’s a worthy slam winner"

Stay safe Melbourne ??"
900,"Will be tough to crack the first GS- just ask Murray has proven over the years. Nadal, Djokovic and you can put Theim in the same bracket aren’t slowing down, so there would always be stiff challenge. 

But I think his time is fast approaching. Imo, it is a matter of ‘when’ not ‘if’."
901,"Yes - the women's tour is getting more physical, either better endurance like Halep, or better shot makers like Osaka/Andreescu, which is the main reason why Serena's been unable to get the comeback she's hoped for - she has not been able to outhit them as easily, and she can't outlast them.  She's looking in great form fitness-wise right now though, so while the window is small, hopefully this year she gets her chance."

An absolute battle. Deep into the Australian summer night. Deep into the 5th.

6) Nick Kyrgios vs Andreas Seppi 2015  
Nick, Home Court, 5th set drama. Need we say more?

5) Rafael Nadal vs Grigor Dimitrov 2007  
It's hard to find another match where the level of play throughout is as high as this one.

4) Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal 2017  
The best rivalry ever. One of the best matches ever. One of the best rallies ever.

3) David Nalbandian vs Lleyton Hewitt 2011

Any one of their 3 AO battles could be on this list. We went with this one.    
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_lvpSguhGvw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lvpSguhGvw)   
1) Rafael Nadal vs Fernando Verdasco 2009  
The best player box reactions ever. The best tiebreak ever played by one player. Arguably one of the best matches of all time.   
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JQCUZ7wH\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JQCUZ7wH_8)   
The Australian Open seems to produce so many all time great matches. It was extremely difficult to narrow this list down to 10. Honourable mentions include:  
Safin vs Federer  
Hewitt vs Nadal  
Djokovic vs Nadal  
Murray vs Federer  
Which ones did we miss?"
903,"People like her should stay home and yell at the TV. Nadal is slow, yes. But this is tennis, not football. If you can't be quiet you are kicked out. Personally I avoid watching his games ever since he refused to give me an autograph after giving my friend one even though we were the only two asking at that time at Stockholm Open."
904,"Another dad joke coming up to lighten up the mood: 

If Mayar Sheriff becomes her city's mayor, she'd be Mayor Mayar.  
If Mayar Sheriff becomes a sheriff, she'd be Sheriff Sheriff.  
if Mayar Sheriff becomes both the mayor and sheriff, she'd be Mayor Sheriff Mayar Sheriff.   


Yea, I'll go away now."
905,"I’m not an expert in tennis but even Rafa doesn’t consider himself as a favorite and his matches were much easier than Djokovic, also Djokovic played well in the ATP cup singles against two of the best players in the tour. Moreover, Even if someone upsets Djokovic, Rafa still has to go past the likes of Thiem and Medvedev who are currently in their prime. By the way I’m a Rafa fan."
906,"Kyrgios turns a tennis match in to a rugby World Cup match atmosphere wise almost every time he plays at the Australian Open, I don’t think you can say that about any other player.

Some other person already said it, but the man is Happy Gilmore and you literally can’t look away when he’s playing like this."
907,"Kyrgios will need the crowd for the Thiem match. I don't think Thiem is used to a Kyrgios type game with a crowd completely against him cheering double faults.

Beyond that, crowds won't really be enough against guys like Djokovic lmao"
908,"I mean Fritz has only himself to blame by choking up completely every time Djoko - who hardly moved at one point during the match - showed some resistance.

Plus the whole notion that he's just faking it entirely is getting ridiculous. On the other hand, I do believe that he's playing it up a little bit. No professional athlete would keep playing with these issues as much as he does if they were this severe, as they're potentially career ending."
909,"I pray PRAY (for dramatic effect) that the new players won't have half the injuries Djoko, Nadal and Federer had and STILL managed to come back and dominate again. 
Are they entertaining? Yes.. are they good? Absolutely. There's the distinction tough.. they are cocky and arrogant because they need to be, they still have to prove themselves ..its a fight. While the others don't have anything to prove anymore. And I will keep saying this regardless how much people might disagree.
Djoko had his ballsy moments, Nadal and Federer too. But that's what happens and wisdom comes with age.. 
Just because you have a brand deal, doesn't make you immediately interesting."
910,"Rafa is basically through to the semis already imo Djere/troicki/evans? ,may aswel give rafa a BYE. De minaur cant beat rafa, he lacks the power/weapons, it would take a career performance for Alex to get the W.
  Fognini, bet your house on him not turning up/getting angry/giving up after one competitive set. Even if he does show up I think he will lack the energy to beat Rafa. Fognini is 33 and unless you're an all time GOAT that's a bad place to be.
 Tsitsipas most recent matches with Rafa did not go well for him. I think that was more to do with Stef not ebing quite on form last year and ofc rafa is too solid for anyone not bringing their A game. very bad matchup for Stef with the single hander. He has a chance but would have to play hyper aggressive and hit his backhand amazingly well. I'm worried that Tsitsipas has developed a complex against rafa and if that's the case then he has no chance. 
 Rafa is almost 100% in the semis unless he gets injured. Djoker similar ( because he is ofc so good) but has a much tricker draw. Chardy is dangerous, tiafoe is also dangerous young and hungry. Fritz has no chance but opelka could be nasty if he has a good serving day. Wawrinka and Raonic are both experienced quality players. Wawrinka 3.0 is still struggling to show us he can play like he did 2013 -2016 and Raonic lacks variety but is dangerous with the serve+ forehand nonetheless. 
 I dont have the info but it seems like Djoker the last few years keeps getting the hardest draws in the early, and no its not a consipiracy. The dude has just been unlucky in that regard."
911,"To those who say Kyrgios is bad for the sport, if this was any other name facing Thiem in the 3rd round, 1) we wouldn't get a 5 setter and 2) there would not be this much hype around it.
Kyrgios brings a name value, something that will be very important once the Big 3 retire. 

I love Kyrgios, some of the shots he was striking in the 5th set ???? when he's on, he's on! Amazing comeback by Thiem tho, the question wasn't IF Kyrgios would start his antics but WHEN, and Thiem showed why he is at the top of the next tier of players!"
912,"Made this last year for fun but never got round to posting!

Some observations on each 20 year period:

1980-1999 Men:

* 25 major winners
* 14 multiple major winners (10 winning 3 or more)
* 7 players won 5 or more majors

2000-2019 Men:

* 18 major winners
* 10 multiple major winners (6 winning 3 or more)
* The big three account for nearly three quarters of the wins
* These 3 were the only ones to win more than 3 majors in this period
* Just 5 men won over three quarters of the majors
* Federer won a quarter of the majors

1980-1999 Women:

* 16 major winners
* 8 multiple major winners
* 5 women won over three quarters of the titles
* 7 women won 4+ majors
* Steffi Graf won over a quarter of the majors

2000-2019 Women:

* 28 major winners (so many!)
* 15 multiple major winners
* 4 women won over half the titles
* 5 women won 4+ majors, 7 won 3+
* Serena Williams won over a quarter of the majors"
913,"I've seen some discussions regarding wheelchair tennis in tennis warehouse, I'd recommend you to search or ask the question there to have more answers. Good luck!

[Link](https://tt.tennis-warehouse.com/)"
914,"Crowd weren't against him, they were doing that thing where you go 'oooohhhhhh' because it isn't a radio response. He was honest. It WAS surprising Simon played like he hadn't hit the ball in ages, very inconsistent. But he also forced those errors. 

It was weird because the commentator pushed that agenda."
915,"Racket string, like guitar strings want to vibrate like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave#Standing_wave_on_a_string_with_two_fixed_ends). The point at which the displacement of the string is the maximum is called a node.

You can disrupt this vibration by placing a mass (a dampener) at one of the nodes. Ideally, it should be placed smack in the middle of the racket face, but then you can't hit the ball without the dampener flying off on every shot. So you compromise, and place it on one of the other nodes, which is less likely to come into contact with the ball.

What you have in the picture is too far from a node to be effective.

A very simple test to whether a dampener works as advertised is to strike the racket against the bottom of your palm, and listen to the sound. If the dampener is effective, you should hear less of the high pitched sound when the racket strikes the bottom of your palm with the dampener than without it."
916,"Hello everyone. So the thing is I have never played tennis until last year on December that I had the change at my 21 years to do it. I am so interested about this beautiful practice that, I just thought to make my personal goal to be a real tennis player, I'm sure it will take me some years, even if I have all the motivation and training possible to reach a high level. However I just asked my personal tennis trainer if at my age, since I am starting barely, could I be able to practice tennis in a professional way? And his answer was No. 

I knew it was going to be no. 
But, who's knows right?

Anyway, I'm looking for a realistic opinion of yours and I really appreciate it.
Btw, depends on the country you live and the opportunities you get to be promoted by an agency or anything like that I know I won't get that any time soon but I mean the possibility to get it if you show yourself the world that you are a good party. Isn't?"
917,"Iirc in the post match interview he said he’s not confident of recovering in 2 days, so probably a withdrawal.

In any case Milos might finally get one over Novak, though I think withdrawals don’t count in H2H?"
918,Haters in this thread don’t seem to understand that emotions exist whether or not a crowd is around to see them. Please forgive Novak for being a competitor and releasing his emotions after pulling through against the odds.
919,"Hsieh: *That is a very impressive all-time power shot.  I'll just half volley it from near the baseline with some weird technique where I shift my hips and don't move my feet and effortlessly return your crushing power for a clean winner.  A for effort, though!*"
920,"Really? This was the moment you lost hope for him? After all this time when he actually produced entertaining tennis and tried? Not when he tanked matches because he knew he was going to lose? Making a commitment to not play the French Open/clay? All of the bullshit he has said and done? 

I am confusion"
921,"Apart from forgetting how to return second serves in the last game, Kokkinakis once again provided a window into an alternative tennis history where he was able to keep fit and competed alongside everyone of his generation."
922,"Man, Rafa has a beautiful smile.  And he's pretty much the best tennis player to ever pick up a racket.

OP, you should know ""Karen"" is a racist, misogynistic slur and you should just call this women by the more civilized term *cunt*"
923,"Stef looking great. Although I have to say his crosscourt bh is still looking questionable to me. It flies really high almost every ball and it is fine when it has depth, but there are times it's quite short and he won't get away with that against the top guys."
924,"The arguing is about Fognini saying stuff like “you’re so lucky” during the match (like he always does) and Caruso said “I didn’t say anything to you the whole match and you kept saying shit, I didn’t expect that from you” (lol). It wasn’t a bad argument and they weren’t insulting each other, just Fognini being Fognini and Caruso venting his frustration after the loss."
925,"Because slams sell extended highlight packages to their broadcasters, they are not going to do it for free.

Because they don't want viewers to be content with watching free 8-10 minute highlights, be satisfied with it, and not watch the full match. Because in sports industry, watching highlights doesn't make money, watching the actual matches does.

Because slams are already institutionalised, unlike smaller tennis tournaments, that they don't need to post 8-10 minute highlights *during the tournament* for free to draw viewers in solely through that strategy. They are slams, they don't need that. If one is interested in extended highlights of a match, they would be interested in it the full match too. Or conversely they could watch extended highlights but don't like tennis enough to spend time to watch any full match and in that case too it doesn't benefit the slams to post extended highlights for free since they are not going to pull that crowd in to watch full matches.

Also I found it interesting that you harp on about atp's highlights strategy through tennis tv whilst naming football as having good highlights because football competitions don't differ from tennis tv in their highlights strategy. If anything, a lot of them are much more stingy than atp because a lot of football competitions are already institutionalised and known enough like slams that they wouldn't benefit from publishing 8-15 minute highlights for free for the same reasons."
926,"Sinner's last 3 1st round matches at a Grand Slam:

&#x200B;

Us Open - Khachanov, won 1st 2 sets then got injured

French Open - Goffin, won in straight sets

Australian Open - Shapovalov, after playing 5 matches finishing yesterday

&#x200B;

Tough"
927,"AO is Rafa's worst slam because he has won only once. Just like FO for other two. But they both great credits for consistently reaching to late stages of FO and I've seen some using that against Rafa for slams outside of FO.. but Rafa's record at AO is pretty consistent whenever he has been able to play. His fan or not I think everyone can admit that he is a bit unlucky here in Australia.

2005- at just 18 reached R16, Played 5sets amazing  against Hewitt (eventual finalist)

2006- DNP

2007 - QF lost convincingly against gongalez ( eventual finalist)

2008- SF bulldozed by Absolute great performance from Tsonga

2009- W (back to back GOAT matches)

2010- QF injured retired Against Andy ( eventual finalist)

2011- QF injured but finished the match

2012- F Probably best match at AO

2013- DNP

2014- F A Match that every rafan and rafa himself would like to forget

2015- QF lost to Berdych , although he was already in poor form

2016- R128 Damn verdasco

2017- F may be Roger deserved more than him

2018- QF retired to Cilic(eventual finalist)

2019- F lol ?? performance by nole

2020- QF Thiem played a very good match ( eventual finalist)

2021-??

Seeing pattern from 2017 I think he should at least reach to Final??. Though I'm not sure if Rafans can handle him losing another ao final, and matching Andy's runners up record.

P.S. I just realised , everyone who has beaten him  and reached final has lost, rafacurse."
928,"They’re letting in 30,000 people a day so hopefully. This week we were only allowed 25% capacity so a lot of those events actually sold out. It’ll be a bit spread out the first few rounds but hopefully less so."

931,"He has beaten all of the top 4 and he has a great record on the big stages against big players. Not many players can do that (maybe warinka and delpo?). 

He is capable of beating anyone if he’s playing well. You can’t say that about most players. For that reason, he is talented. 

He’s just a mental basket case though"
932,"No it isn't usually that bad (with the cheering after 1st serve faults).  I've been to big matches at past Aus Opens where there is Aussie who has a good chance to win. The crowd might murmur a bit after the opponent's fault but I haven't experienced outright cheering. It gets rowdy but I think ultimately Aussies know how to behave.

The vibe in the stands seems way more relaxed this year. I think the Open organisers are just happy to have some spectators given all the local lockdowns and general attitude towards the tennis in Melbourne this year. Also there are a lot of empty seats so with all that extra space perhaps people feel more freedom to shout out."
933,"I unfortunately couldn't see the match. I know Sinner was a little tired, but Shapo had killer instinct serving from left side and closing with forehand. How do you explain today's result? Was Sinner tired? Is Shapo in general better than Sinner? What made the difference?"
934,"He had more power but Dolgopolov is another one who reminds me a bit of Su Wei. Excellent skills and lots of unusual shots. 

He managed to reach #13 and the world and may have gotten higher than that if not for injuries and chronic illness."

936,"You and someone below hit the hammer on the nail. I've seen him play live twice, vs Karlovic and Nadal at Cincy. Once the amusement of stupid shit he says or unconventional shots he tries wears off, it's pretty boring. There's no flow and he's really inconsistent.

Contrary to popular opinion, Idt his ceiling is as high as everyone thinks. He plays high risk, high reward. The most he can improve is his mind and fitness. That'd make him a consistent participant up to the quarters at majors, but there will always be overall better players than him with more big match experience bc they didn't play b-ball and drink milkshakes before matches"
937,"Thiem just hasn’t been putting anything into the net. Nick hasn’t gotten any free points. 

That being the case, Nick has played absolutely out of his skin to be where he is in this match. Much like Kokk the other night, it may not end up being the result we wanted, but it’s an incredibly hard fought five setter."
938,"Looks beautiful but is very unpractical. More of a tourist trap and a place to take insta pics. 

There is no fence, so you have to walk a mile to pick up the balls. The background is reflecting and I guess it's damn windy 90% of the time."
939,I don't think there is another player I've watched as much as I've watched Tiafoe whose game I understand less. He is just a source of bafflement to me. Reminds me of Dimitrov in this regard - he has all the raw tools imaginable: huge groundstrokes; big serve; good net skills; great speed and athleticism...but he often struggles to package those elements together into a cohesive game week to week
940,"I'll tell you what's really shit, and it ain't having an all-expenses paid trip to MEL with a $100,000 payout for a 1R exit... it's what Victorians have had to go through over the past 12mths to put ourselves the position of having 0 community COVID cases after recording nearly 800 a day. 

Honestly, anybody who want's to have even a slither of respect down under will want to cop it all on the chin because the complaints of a bunch of rich tennis players fall on incredibly deaf ears here... 

I mean, is the field perfectly level? No. Is it ideal? No. 

But is it incredible that the AO is even going ahead let alone with crowds in the middle of a global pandemic? Absolutely. 

Players should just be grateful for the opportunity to play in front of fans, win lose or draw.

Nothing surprising from the Paire but nonetheless shockingly tone-deaf..."
941,"Honestly such a class act. Remember how he teamed up with Tomic for the doubles a few years back? He didn’t do it for himself, he did it for that piece of shit in hopes he could turn his career around. Turned out to be a waste of time!

Nadal speaks and everyone listens! 

The sport will be lost for a few years after the retirement of  this great man!"
942,Heartbreaking loss for kyrgios. He played lights out tennis for the first hour and a half. Titanic effort from thiem to come back from two sets down. It was a game of two halves. Kyrgios was all over him for the first two sets. That us open win really made him stronger and he went for his shots. Crazy how calm and composed he was. FAA's loss to dan evans last week really helped him find form. He is having a hell of a tournament. Halep is looking good so far.
943,"The break between sets lasts 2 minutes. Apparently Shapovalov voiced his need to go to the toilet after sitting on the bench for over 30 seconds, while it's customary to say it at the start of the break and go right away. The umpire was worried that he would not make in the set break time."
944,"The last set of that Svitolina's match was so amazing. They were giving their all at 5-5 on the second set, Svitolina fighting for it to be over and the other girl just wanting a thrid set.

amazing, so tense"
945,"Ya he always plays better in the shade, and struggles more in the sun. I guess its because of the contact lenses + his breathing issues in the hot and humid conditions, its crazy he is so successful with so much medical conditions ... Or maybe he just hates the sun who knows lol"
946,I feel like this just bulletproofs my idea that the entire Australian continent should be repurposed as a staging area for American nuclear missiles pointed at the Chinese Communist Party.  The Sydney Opera House is nice but we can put it on a barge and float it to Antarctica
947,"I don't much have an opinion on the crowd, but I am fascinated to see what happens when it's not Humbert being treated this way, but rather Theim, one of the ""Subreddit Darlings"". I have a slight hunch the thread won't be as..... forgiving."

949,"You've got great form. I know in a previous post for another person I've noted the whole palm up to the sky on the racket meaning losing power but you get into the trophy position well and have great contact at the top. 

If you wanted to add power, you can try to point your hip to the sky as well. Take a look at how your hips are straight here. It's not needed for a great serve but can add effortless power.

950,"Seriously crowds are what makes this sport into the greatest sport on earth. Minus a good crowd ( like Miami 2017 or Acapulco 2019), or Medvedev 2019 US Open crowds, there is no spectacle.

Last year's US Open grand slam final was a 0 on the scale compared to the 2019 final which was a 95 imo"
951,"I am here to provide answers! 

I've worked on grand slams doing this exact job and let me just say, they THROW YOU INTO IT. I had one day of training, and then next day started (but editing was already my profession). 

The 2 minute limit is likely because they legally are told they can't post anything longer. For the ones I worked on, there's AI systems literally editing up points for you to then compile together and upload (not sure if it's how they do it). BUT the early days in the tournament are stressful hell. They probably have 1-2 people editing 40+ games in one day...there's no way they can actually WATCH the games, and there's pressure to get the highlights out once the game ends. If the highlights are dogwater, it's because the grand slam organizations don't value them as much as we'd like them to."
952,"Sinner's already a better player than Shapo is IMO. If he doesn't stand THAT far back, he puts alot more pressure on Shapo's 2nd serve, which is the shakiest part of his game, and wins that match in 3 or 4 sets, IMO. I mean obviously I'm thrilled as a Shapo fan, but if I'm a Sinner fan (which I'm quickly becoming!) I'm disappointed at the game plan he followed."
953,"Do other players not have high quality matches? Do other players not have long points? Do other players not go for their own towels? 

He didn't get an official warning after first time the clock hit 0, he was told multiple times to hurry it up.

Does he really think it would be fair to a person on the other side of the net (regardless who it is) for him to just take as much time as he wishes?

There should of course be some leniency, and he got it. But there is a limit for everything."

955,"I really enjoy watching Kyrgios play. When he’s on top of his game, I feel like he has a really good sense of touch and what he can and cannot do. Having said that, it looks like he’s a bit rusty coming off the quarantine. Still rooting tho"
956,"It was the same at the atp finals in London. I had to up my volume way too much to hear the calls more clearly. Though I think at the ao the calls come much faster and are a bit louder. But I'm all in favour of the automatic calling, it is a huge improvement."
957,"It's interesting to watch how stubborn Djokovic is-- he loses a backhand-to-backhand rally, so he goes back to it at the next opportunity and makes sure he doesn't lose again.

I've seen him do the same thing when he screws up a drop shot."

959,"Nik is the equivalent of the kid and school who goes ‘ I know you are but what am I’ and then wonders why people don’t want to be around/talk/acknowledge him. 

Nik will then spin this comment off to the likes of ‘Novak is just jealous/he isn’t serious about COVID/immature or how novak insta being a role model for the game’. What, now Nik is offended that Novak said this? Let me guess, Novak’s racist now? Or Novak is bullying in the workplace? No wait, Novak hates Indonesian people/s, that’s what will come out on media. Now when you want Novak to be honest, he will be lynched, he can’t win. This has been the case his whole career. Novak can’t win. Just like the Adria Tour, it had to go through serbian approval before they could play, wasn’t just Novak who got up and started a tournament but people will have you believe that. 

It’s easy to play the victim. It takes more strength to be the mature one in the conversation (Novak has been putting up with this for multiple years).

To add, Nik is essentially a hypocrite. When Melb was in lockdown he fled to Canberra where they didn’t have restrictions. If he was in America/Europe he would have broken so many rules and would have contracted it. Nik hasnt blasted his American friends about getting COVID."

Here, flags are everywhere: on cars, outside houses and businesses, at sporting events, on hats, clothes, underwear, bathing suits, truly everywhere. There's a special procedure you have to follow to fold the flag. Former military officers are buried wrapped in a flag. In school, students are made to stand and pledge allegiance to the flag every day.

My instinct is to call it a flag cult, but I think that's a bit too extreme. It's certainly a strange aspect of United States-ian culture."
962,"I don't have the technical knowledge to dissect his game beyond ""he runs fast and hits hard"", but I had a brief chat and took a photo with him after his win against Goffin and he seems like a lovely dude.

Also Diego might have a challenger for best dancer."
963,"This is the fifth time he's achieved this feat in majors. Fognini at Wimbledon '16, Kubot at Wimbledon '11, Canas at Wimbledon '02(seeing a pattern beginning to emerge?), and Ferreiro(not to be confused with Ferrero) at RG '09 have also been felled by Flo's tenacity. He's evergreen in the truest sense."

The format is different from the one you have in the bracket competitions you're used to - you bet on matches using real bookmakers' odds, but the betting currency is competition points (every player gets an initial stack of 1000), and whoever has the most points at the end of the AO wins! We're looking forward to having new participants from r/tennis. Enjoy the AO!"
967,"It is heartbreaking to realise that the man has put all his effort into it, and then see him these last years suffer these losses against players who are on paper weaker than him. And then to realize that time is quickly running out.
I am late into watching tennis, so I did not have the chance to watch him at his peak. Although his match against Tsitsipas in RG was a superbe 1HBH fiesta.   I wished he could put some of that big play again. Really as a 1HBH Fan, I would like to see him go out in style...
I am just so sad."

972,"Taylor Fritz with a smile: 'Fifth set, he looked pretty good to me!'

Adds: 'I have to give credit in the fifth set, he was really good. Nothing like the third and fourth set. He was serving unbelievable, two first serves and barely missing any spots.'


Fritz: 'I should have expected that. If he was really, really injured, he wouldn't have kept playing. He looked like he was struggling in 3rd & 4th, he didn't look like he was struggling in the fifth... Maybe he fought through it. I'm happy for him he had such a good recovery.'

973,"Djokovic - exemplifies arrogance, always has. Cheap medical time out strategies throughout whole career, chucks a sook when he starts losing then when he makes a comeback he’s thinks he’s the next coming of Jesus or something. Also whinges that he doesn’t get the love from the non-Serbian fans like Fedal. Perhaps if he changed he would get what he so desires."

'Quarrel with far-reaching consequences

'Nebojsa Viskovic speaks with Serbian passion about his fellow countryman Djokovic, but he doesn't want to know anything about chauvinism. In fact, Viskovic once got into trouble with the Djokovic family.  

""I was commenting from the studio in Belgrade in 2008 at a game between Djokovic and Nadal in Hamburg when all of a sudden Djokovic's father stormed into the booth with the explicit request if I would like to comment a bit more pro-Novak,"" says Viskovic.  

""I was surprised. He then complained to my employer RTS (the Serbian public broadcaster, ed.) And partly because of his influence I was suddenly not allowed to comment on Djokovic's parties. I immediately quit my job at RTS.""  

""Incidentally, father Djokovic and I made up again a few years later. The event did not influence my professional relationship with Novak in those years either."" '

..It's nice they kissed and made up but jeez what a narcissistic douchebag!"
975,"This day is a minefield. So many players in the men’s draw are lined up against very stylistically similar opponents, and while a ton of underdogs have a chance at winning, if both play their peak there are unlikely to be a lot of upsets today. Since tennis is tennis, this likely means there will be even more upsets as many athletes feel the pressure to win a safe one, but have to easy way to do so.  Still time btw to join the Picking Competiton at [AO Competition](https://degensclub.com/competitions/ao-tipping-competition/events) by the way.  Free to join and some smol but nice cash prizes.

**Djokovic Tiafoe :** Looking at the first round scores this is going to be a great matchup. So just keeeeep looking at the scores. It’s tough to write anything about Novak Djokovic other than “he’s too good.” The guy has the personality of an almond, but he simply has worked his way to the top and despite the hard work of other younger players on tour, time spent winning makes good decisions and efficient tactics more of a muscle memory thing than a conscious decision thing, so the more intense the match gets the better he plays.  

Tiafoe was almost bad enough to lose the first set to Travaglia, but eventually he managed to get the job done as Travaglia’s legs got more and more fatigued. I’m impressed he was even able to take the court after his contest with Sinner the night before, and it’s certainly not Tiafoe’s fault that his opponent was fatigued, so it was a well-deserved win. Tiafoe’s best chance at doing damage to Djokovic is to serve the lights out, and Djokovic covers the outwide serve (Tiafoe’s best from the ad side) so well that this is kinda an empty pursuit. Djokovic in 3.

**Opelka Fritz :** Opelka got the job done fairly easily in the first round, but Yen Hsun-Lu is not really a tour level player anymore. Fritz has frosted tips, and even though he’s a decade late, it’s a pretty good look. I am still endeavoring to say 3 positive things about Taylor Fritz in every post, and that counts as 2. The third is that he is likely to win this match. 

Fritz has won most of their previous meetings, and even though he plays tennis like he’s more sleepy than hungry to win, he has an interesting combination of skills that make him a favorite. His serve doesn’t win him matches outright, but it’s a very easy motion and is good enough to get a lot of easy returns against Opelka. His offense during the rallies is mostly forehand offerings that aren’t clean winners, but these are good enough to get up high on Opelka can allow him to go for things he shouldn’"
976,"Federer’s shotmaking, technique, footwork, touch, variety, consistency and all court game put him in a place all by himself. The others are talented, very much so but Federer has so many qualities that collectively put him in a unique category I don’t think we’ll see another player enter for a long time."
977,"He (and most of tennis journos/Federer fans tbf) has a very narrow and biased definition of what constitutes talent.

It's the same reason why you'll see someone argue that Kyrgios and Brown are just as talented as Nadal/Djokovic."

980,"I fucking hate Evans' game with a passion, but I can't dog on it too much because, obviously, it worked for him. Frustrating as shit to watch him slice and float every single backhand (especially when his topspin backhand isn't bad)--no reason it should be this effective against some of the top players in the world."
981,You can tell by the measly upvotes that this subreddit is full of anti-Djoko sentiment. Probably half of these idiots can't even get a decent rally going. No respect for the sport and its ambassadors. Smh.
982,"These are amazing to read. My only real disagreement comes from Sinner-Shapovalov. Sinners playing great, but Shapovalov has been serving lights out, and seemed to get back to his solid netplay. If he can focus pressure on Sinner's forehand, I'd give it to him in 4/5."

Strange management from the Aus Open, weird to take the players off the court and undermined the integrity but the match somewhat."

But yes, maybe Anglo users see the situation differently and believe he's stronger than a solid top 30"

""Sorry, that's not like the perfect answer.""

987,Zverevs side of the draw is so weak it hurts my brain looking at it. Some complete tomato can is making the 4th round and plays Zverev (lol if he can stave off playing 5 sets against world no.100s) for a spot in the QF
988,"if you want WTA tour matches, then TC Plus is the only real option in the US. It'll also have a decent amount of ATP matches, though of course, bigger matches are often going to be exclusive to Tennis Channel proper for some tournaments (and the French Open... where you'll also see some matches exclusive to NBC or Peacock)."

Amazing performance, he deserves all the respect as well as Kokk."

One tweak that will help you the most right now is to keep your palm facing down throughout your serve. The image above shows when your palm faces up to the sky. You lose a lot of power and messes up your kinetic chain"
992,"Felix, I know you are overall a pretty chill dude out there, but if there was any time to show some emotion it'd be now. Let out a scream in frustration, smash a racket, IDK haha, just fire yourself up man cause you look like you're asleep out there. 

All Evans is doing is slicing the ball in play and letting you make an unforced error, stop beating yourself and this match is very winnable."
993,"I used to be a big shaps fan for his wacky and varied game. But his on court attitude is so pissy and sour, I dunno if I can keep barracking for him. Other young players (not just sinner) are not so dickish."
994,"I hope Kokkinakis can stay healthy, I really do. He has a game good enough for a top 30 push if he can. I still expect Tsitsipas to win this match but I'm impressed at how much he's pushed Tsitsipas so far."
995,"In case you missed it, 39-yr old Feliciano Lopez has just won from 2 sets down. He had a win probability of only 0.4% after the second set. This [win probability graph swing](https://www.statsinsider.com.au/ten/match?matchid=TEN_2021_1_ATP_2567_14465_104847) is just mental."
996,"He is by far the most interesting player to watch. His backhand is actually extremely good, he gets to the net loads and he's got great feel. He's also surpringly athletic and plays a lot of dramatic points. 

Also his serve is fun to watch alone."
997,"Nakashima for the second week in a row in a tight 3 set scrap against a grizzled veteran in the Quimper SF

This time he held on at some crucial junctures to pass the test v Lukas Lacko (former top 50), 4-6 7-5 7-5. He has actually looked pretty mediocre all week yet has won his matches on mental strength. Pretty good sign if you ask me....

Plays Zapata or Gojowczyk in the final, imo if it is the latter Gojo is still favorite because he is dangerous indoors"
998,"That story is, uh, something. It's easy to have an uncharitable take on Djokovic's 2020, but when you start to imply that he'll use his trophy speech to go on an anti-vax rant, maybe you're being a little sensational."
999,"Man this is such a bad take. 

Independent of whether it was real or not, you never want to go into the business of judging the degree and existence of an opponent’s injury.

Theres degrees to injuries. And not all of them take you out, and some are worse than others. Sometimes you push harder than others. Some allow you to play more than others. 

Taking this complex situation and minimizing it into a “he’s faking it” opinion is just silly and makes you look like a sore loser."
1000,"I wouldn’t call AO his worst slam, he’s won it the least, but he’s usually always there. Even when he said his expectations were low in 2015, he still made it to the QF. 

He’s pretty much been at least in the QF since 2007, with only a few exceptions. Djokovic and Federer, the guys who’ve won this eight and six times respectively, are probably the only other players with similar clips. 

In fact, let’s look at it:

Nadal: QF (2007, 2010, 2011, 2015, 2018, 2020) - 6 times

SF (2008) - 1 time

F (2009, 2012, 2014, 2017, 2019) - 5 times, 1 victory, 4 losses. 

So that’s 12 times in 14 years that he’s made it to at least the quarterfinals (other two are the R1 loss in 2016 and the DNP in 2013). 

Djokovic: QF (2009, 2010, 2014) - 3 times

SF - never. 

F (2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020) - 8 times, all victories. 

So that’s 11 times in 14 years that he’s made it to the quarterfinals (others are R4 in 2007, R2 in 2017, and R4 in 2018), though the record is better since he never lost a semifinal and made it to more finals. 

Federer’s also got a damn good record there since 2007:

QF - always made it to the semifinals

SF (2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2020) - 7 times

F (2007, 2009, 2010, 2017, 2018) - 5 times, 4 victories. 

So that’s 12 times in 14 years that he’s made it to the semifinals (other two times are R3 in 2015 and R4 in 2019). This doesn’t even take his 2004-2006 record into account, which would make it 15 times in 17 years that he’s made it to the semifinals (won in 2004 and 2006, SF in 2005). 

So while Djokovic is obviously number one in Australian Open performances, and Federer’s number two, to call the Australian Open Nadal’s worst major is unfair, because of his high performances and good results even with the lack of wins. After all, Djokovic and Federer are the top two in AO victories on the men’s side, and he still rivals them both in performances."
1001,"Honestly, having watched tennis for the past 20 years and following Halep religiously for 7-8 years, I have never been angry watching a match before.

It was great to see Halep dig deep as always, but this match was NOT a true indication of her usual standards and quality. 

Pretty poor match on her part as she allowed her opponent to dictate rather than her usual role as the fearless baseline aggressor. Good luck coming back 5-2 down against a Swiatek.

It would have sucked to see Halep go down in such a way, but she progressed and that’s all that matters. I am confident she won’t play any worse than tonight!"
1002,"Really weird to list Andreescu as a fixed option despite her playing her first match in 1.5 years. That being said, I think the favorite is Osaka. She will probably be taking the queen title from Serena when Serena retires."
1003,"“What the fuck are you doing bro? You’re a fuckwit.”

I was shocked at the rude language. Picking up my shopping I apologised.

“Sorry, didn’t see you there” I muttered slowly looking up, 

“Oh my god you’re Nick Kyrgios”

“Nah bro I’m late, get out of my way bro.”

“Oh sorry”, I was growing more flustered by the second as the awkward exchange continued.

“Wait, bro, is that milk?”, Nick’s eyes lit up as he stared at my basket.

“Uh... yeah um it is full c-“ Nick cut me off.

“Bro nah, like honestly bro, that’s actually good ay”.

To my absolute disbelief, Nick Kyrgios reached right into my shopping basket, took out a 1.5 litre bottle of full cream milk and unscrewed the lid.

“Bro, this is it, like, nah bro this is the pinnacle”.

He upended the bottle and began chugging it right in front of me, maintaining eye contact. As he finished he gave a satisfied sign, wiped his mouth and placed the milk back into my basket.

“Like honestly bro, look where you’re going.”

And with that he made his way out of the shop, muttering to himself about how the cashier was sitting in his box."
1004,"Top players bring in the crowds so I feel like this isn’t “fair”, but I still think it’s right. Top players get endorsements and already make millions. Increasing prize money at the lower levels will make tennis a more attractive sport to play for more players and deepen the talent pool. All for this."
1005,"Agree. One problem players won't have is hitting a great serve, the linesperson calling it out before the returner barely puts it back, and you having to replay a point you won or would have won. Or the umpire telling the returner that the out call came after he hit the ball. Use Hawkeye in all Majors and M1000 from now on. You lose the dynamic of how a player deals with bad calls. But you gain more and for the most part the outcome of a tennis match is decided by the player's ability to hit the ball. Not how they handle bad calls."
1006,"He will play. Not going to give up his chances at his favorite slam. It may not look like it right now, but the next  next next gen (!) is finally at a point where they will likely topple the big 3 at their favorite slams, considering their age, long career and the injuries that come with it. The USO is anybody's to win already."
1007,"""I understand that Australia went through hard lockdowns to get case numbers down, but they should be willing to risk it a little so that the tennis tournament can be fair!""

Do you have any idea how removed from reality this sounds? Maybe players don't like that things aren't fair, but to be honest, the top players are always building advantages on top of advantages, and to say that should be a reason to ease up on covid policies is absolutely asinine."
1008,"I found Jannik Sinner's post-match interview in Italian and used google translate. Here is what he said: ''*I refuse to believe that I have lost due to fatigue* *.* *If I played tomorrow I might have won the first set anyway, but he would have made me run like crazy and I would have faced the rest of the match equally tired.* *The truth is that* *Denis played better in certain situations* *, especially the most important points, and he served better than me, that's all.* *He deserved to win.""*     At 19 years old, with this kind of attitude he will have a very bright future"
1009,"Anybody else seeing the crazy number of matches that have been ending on a double fault on match point at the Aussie Open? It seems unproportional.

Has anybody seen data or want to make an infograph showing double faults throughout a match vs on set point / match point?"
1010,Did you know that 200 unnamed scientists with degrees unrelated to anything close to science agreed that wearing a plain white shirt increases your odds of winning a 2nd round match at the Australian Open
1011,Fognini being cool af but also the first to realise it got awkward for the kid and went for the fist bump. Such a stand-up guy. No wonder he's friends with so many players off court albeit a few antics on court.

1014,Take a bow Nick. Fought and played for the crowds til the very end. The Australian Open was good while it lasted. No crowds has absolutely taken the life out of this shit and Nick has nothing to regret
1015,I agree with him on all points. Bit of an unreasonable time violation there (which is just such a needless and nitpicky rule to begin with) combined with shit calls. Tough situation to be put in against the world #1.
1016,"I'm sorry but it's ridiculous. Not only was he playing more tennis than the two women (since the WTA switched the last two rounds to a 3rd set final tiebreak) but the excuse of ""then he'd have to play two best-of-five matches in a row"" doesn't hold up when weather can force that to happen anyways.

It's just really dumb scheduling and regardless of the final result against Shapo, it should have never been played today.

Edit: People keep bringing up that women play best of three multiple days in a role all the time. That wasn't my point.

The AO officials literally said they were giving those women an additional day off because of playing Saturday. That's where my issue lies.

I also missed FAA also playing today and my point still stands. Him winning doesn't change my feelings about it."
1017,"You guys should actually watch the interview. Aside from the fact there's a very obvious language barrier, Stef was asked to comment on the young players who are playing well. He was obviously not saying that he was better than the big 3, more that newer younger players competing for titles it's more interesting than the same players winning for the last 15 years. Which I completely agree with."
1018,"Not that I'm any fan of Zverev... But does anyone seriously think that this is a bad photo of him?
Maybe cause I'm a straight guy I can't really evaluate a guy's appeal. But to me, those arms look like fucking shotguns."

1026," **Voundrousova Cirstea :** Voundrousova had the much easier match between these two, and made fairly simple work of Rebecca Marino. Cirstea looked to be on the struggle bus early against Kvitova, but her offense found its range and what she has shown time and time again is that when she’s locked into her game, it’s very difficult to find your way out of a rally. What sits here is a very interesting round of offense vs defense. Voundrousova is one of the most reliable players at making her opponent play extra balls. She utilizes the dropshot greatly, and being lefty she really exposes her opponents backhands well. Cirstea struggles early in matches, but has the game to win this. It’s a tough tough ask and could take a long time, but I think Cirstea’s conditioning is the question here. If it holds up, she can make the 4th round. Cirstea in 3.

**Muguruza Diyas :** Muguruza is just on fire. Samsonova came into that match playing her best tennis and serving great. Didn’t matter. I think it’s a similar story here. Diyas has found wins where she really needed them, and slowed down Pera’s crispy offense. She’s a great defender, but it’s unlikely to matter too much here. Muguruza in 2 hard fought sets.

**Jabeur Osaka :** Jabeur and Osaka both crush the ball. Both didn’t have much trouble with their previous opponents. This is the first real test for Osaka’s level. Jabeur’s offense is legit, yet it’s the exact thing that Osaka’s movement and counterpunching have frequently frustrated. If she struggles early, she’ll likely find her way back to even. Osaka in 2.

**Sabalenka Li :** I’m hyped for this matchup but I wish Li was playing a less aggressive hitter. Sabalenka hits harder than anyone on tour, and Kasatkina was playing well, but always seemed like she was bailing water out of a sinking boat. The heat didn’t help, and the ball is flying through the air well for Aryna. Ann Li has quietly become the 3rd best player from the US, and Corney was inches away from forcing a third but Li was able to outlast all the moonballs and all the gets. I think here there is no way to guess what is going to happen. Li goes after her offense and if you move Sabalenka you always have a puncher’s chance. She’ll struggle on serve though, but her movement will at least let her earn some Sabalenka errors. I lean Sabalenka obviously, but Li is a rising player and it’s always interesting to see them move up thru levels to see where their peak really is. Keep in mind that she didn’t lose last week, and her last win was against Brady. Someone in 3.

**Potapova Williams :** Great wins for Potapova and I admit I was not sure she would get either of them. Unfortunately, Serena has been beating pova’s for years now. Serena looks like a real threat for a major in 2021 despite deciding to dress like a super hero. Serena in 2.

**Swiatek Ferro :** Swiatek and Ferro both have been improving round by round and it’s making me wonder if I really understand either player’s game on hardcou"
1027,"Was there live, nearly died a few times and had to take several laps around Rod Laver to calm down because I am a Tsitsipas tragic. Loved this for Kokkinakis though! Hope he gets a few wildcards because he deserves so much."
1028,"To give some idea of the level of value to those who didn't attend:  if you bought a ticket to 2 matchups in each group ($160 total) you would see ALL of the world's top 13 (minus Roger) for less than the price of a day 1 session at AO center court. That includes matchups such as zverev vs djokovic, nadal vs tsitsipas + de minaur, and thiem vs monfils. Most of those matches didn't actually happen, but still."
1029,"I think there needs to be an on-court light that is visible to all. Audio only is not enough, particularly when crowd noise is loud. There is already a light on the umpire’s dashboard for this - just extend it to a light bulb on top of the chair or something."
1030,"I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Sam Stosur retired from all tennis effective immediately after that. Not that she played rubbish. She didn’t. She just strikes me as a person who knows when their time may be up and won’t play past that time. She’s set for life, she doesn’t need to."
1031,"I have been playing with the rf97 with kevlar in the mains and poly in the crosses and I am getting told that I will get arm pains, but haven’t felt any. How long would it take to start feeling arm pain?"
1032,"/u/dnuw normally makes the bracket contests but unfortunately Tourneytopia doesn't have one this year. Pinning this one instead.

1033,"I usually can’t stand the guy, but what are you insinuating here? If anything, I respect the guy even more and his mental prowess to push through the pain barrier.

Even at the end after the interview. He gingerly picked up his bags which is not a good sign if you are a fan!"
1034,He wants to use the restroom for peeing and he is discussing all this while drinking more water. I understand it is for hydrating himself. But it just is funny discussing about having to pee while downing a couple of bottles of water. ;p
1035,"His tie-break record has been insane as well. From memory he lost one to Demon, but then he has won consecutive tie-breaks against Posposil, Bedene, Kecmanovic, Khachanov (x2) and Travaglia. Just insane clutch. 

Shame he's probably too knackered to beat Shapo lol"
1036,"Popyrin has made it to 3R in the past 2 years here, but he’s benefitted from 2 retirements from seeds (Tsonga last year, Thiem the year before). Would be his first win in a completed match over a seed at the AO!"
1037,My favorite WTA player.  So glad she pulled that one out.  Insane angles.  80mph aces... awesome.  Her biggest first serve was 86mph.  She bonked in some second serves just above 60mph.  Tactical genius.
1038,"If there's one thing you can count on when new sports seasons begin, it's reports of player X ""being in the best shape of their life.""

Best of luck to Nick, but these reports almost never turn into better results."
1039,"I don’t think he is overrated as such because he does have talent and potential. 
He just doesn’t have any work ethic to back it up which he himself admits.

If he put in more effort and got himself a coaching team he would be a great player."
1040,"He was taking too much time in between points. Chair umpire took away his first serve. Tiafoe didn’t like that.

Don’t let that take away from how well Tiafoe played for the first 3.5 sets of this match though."

1042,You're seeing here the difference between a top five player and a top 100 player. Cabrera is in the top 0.5% of players in the world. But the gulf is enormous. Haleps too good and Cabrera just isn't in that league.
1043,"To the detractors and naysayers, Melbourne has more population than Connecticut and despite this, the latter has recorded over 200k covid cases and 6k deaths. 

I dare anyone to challenge how taking a cautious approach is somehow the worse thing that has happened to humanity? ?????"
1044,"Goddamn, this was so sad to watch. Monfils is such a wholesome, positive dude and brings such great energy and entertainment to the sport. Hope he's able to find that amazing form he had during parts of 2019 again. We're behind you La Monf!"
1045,"Easy to hate on Bernie and there's much he brings on himself but I just thought I'd toss up a few other perspectives to go with the general shitshow that has been his professional tennis career. 

- Have dealt with him a few times over the years and actually found him reasonably cordial and self-effacing.

- His dad seems rather scary. 

- When dialled in, I actually quite like watching him play. He uses a lot of guile and disguise and can be a very smart player. Depends on match up though. Tomic v Dolgopolov was like pulling teeth. Interesting against a heavy hitter or aggressive player though. 

- Had the capability to get to a Wimbledon semi or final even. Terrific sliced backhand and because he can shot select so late, had a decent advantage over many of the heavy hitters not comfortable on the surface. Moved best on grass and shorter points helped. The slower the surface and the more work he had to put in, the more he got found out. For a big unit, he never got enough freebies on serve, and that plus his many other well documented issues probably stopped him progressing further at say a Wimbledon. 

- Beat Wawrinka on grass when Australia played Switzerland in Davis Cup. Took a set off Roger. Lleyton lost both his singles matches but I recall Bernie still came out looking like the bad guy. 

- Has won 4 career titles. 

- His only chance against Shapo is if he gets thrown by his playing style. Not sure it will happen but I don't wish him badly - for whatever reason I can't really hate the guy."
1046,"I called it pre-tournament that Dan was my dark horse for the title, and he did it. So glad he’s finally got his title, and it completes his nice redemption arc after the ban. 

I openly admit to being a massive Evo fan, so am absolutely made up for him. Tough draw next week, but let’s see how it goes"
1047,"Goffin had 2 MPs trying to serve it out in the 4th set and 2 more in the tiebreaker. Brutal.

Goffin's Ls are either getting completely stomped or snatching defeat from the jaws of victory - like this one. Been quite a lot of Ls lately."
1048,"i mean, they offer live fullscreen streams of any match you could want to watch. i don't get the complaints about espn's broadcast tv coverage of majors in the early days of the tournaments, they're targeting a larger casual audience."
1049,"[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-08/top-tennis-players-to-quarantine-and-play-in-adelaide/13042982](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-08/top-tennis-players-to-quarantine-and-play-in-adelaide/13042982)

&#x200B;

It's all politics. The Victorian government put a cap on the number of players entering quarantine in the state, so alternative arrangements had to be made. The South Australian government agreed to host 50 people under the condition they played in an exhibition match. Hence, the top three male and female players were selected. They still quarantined for 14 days, and had the same restrictions on movement as players quarantining in Melbourne. The only advantage had over the rest of the players is likely having larger quarantine rooms (I think Djokovic had a house?). 

No quarantine = no tournament. I'm sick of players using quarantine as an excuse for losing (not including those in hard lockdown). EVERYONE had to quarantine (bar most Australian players), and there is always a risk of COVID exposure when travelling. They should be grateful to be playing at all."
1050,"Of course they get special treatment. They can bring more people with them and can train for a longer period of time.

Do they deserve it? Well, that's an interesting one. Tiley's quote about business would make sense if it wasn't tennis that proclaims itself as the most ""equal"" sport. It would also be better from the ""business"" point of view to have more men's matches on main courts as historically they attract bigger attendance and viewership figures. But in pursuit of equality, they split it roughly 50/50. 

Also, what is the basis for determining who makes that special list? If it is top-3, why was it Serena and not Kenin (who is the reigning champion)? If it's based on historical achievements, why do we have Thiem over Wawrinka? So they don't even have clear criteria to determine who is eligible for this top status."
1051,"Would someone please explain to me how the draws work for each round of the opens? Is it a new random draw each round (with respects to the seeds) kinda like the English FA Cup? Is the bracket set all the way to the top like the NCAA basketball tournaments? Is it more like the NFL where the highest seeds always play the lowest-ranked available opponent? Do the different opens handle draws differently? If so, is there an official source documenting how these things work?"
1052,"Might sound harsh, but like I've said before, Shapovalov's brainless ball-bashing style might win him a few big titles (I say this only because bashers always have that moment in their careers where they go through an almost unplayable patch where their shots are clicking rather than UEs galore) but he's never going to be a consistently good player you can always count on to be competing for big titles."
1053,Trademark backhand shot to win the match. I couldn't believe what i saw but i had a feeling thiem might come back to win. I had a feeling it was going to be five sets. Hope kyrgios can take a lot out of that loss. He should have won.
1054,"Just as last pointer, in the fourth set when Popy was facing the match point, his win probability was only 1.9% as per these data guys ([Source](https://www.statsinsider.com.au/ten/match?matchid=TEN_2021_1_ATP_2567_25838_128552)). 

What a win for all Aussie fans. I'm so excited I might jut get on the beers haha"
1055,"Probably lots of other things but one crucial thing is your lack of forward momentum.

Look where you land, behind the baseline! You want to land inside the court.

You wanna toss the ball a bit into the court for that."
1056,"Funny how many times I've seen 'why does the media talk about him so much, he's a nobody' on this sub... and yet there's like 3 posts about him on the front page, and posts about him are highly upvoted. Guys, you are contributing perfectly to something you hate. r/tennis wants the media to ignore him, but is incapable of doing it themselves."
1057,"Just wanted to point out that Steffi retired at 30, not 31. I'm probably one of the biggest Steffi Graf fans out there, but I think her slam winning days were almost done. She was way too injured and getting to 22 itself was very lucky, Hingis should have clearly won that RG final but threw it away.

Steffi could have very small  chances at RG 2000 & 2001, AO 2001 AO though."
1058,"The Australian open is normally played in school holidays, so it's very easy to get loads of kids in. School will be in session. On top of that there's a pandemic and there was an outbreak scare this week. I think a lot of people will just save their tennis viewing experience for the Australian Open."
1059,Sinner looks like a promising talent. He practices with masha and has a good support team. He could go far. Fognini is looking red hot. On his day he could beat anyone. Talk about easy power. He is not a big guy but he generates so much power. Can't wait for the aussie open.
1060,"Sinner is in a 3 setter right now, still in the doubles, and if he wins would have to play twice tomorrow potentially. Then he’s got Shapo first round main draw AO on Monday.

That’s insane. He has every incentive to tank."
1061,"I really, really, REALLY wished he won this, Stan infamously has the tendency to lose energy when down in matches, especially in Best of Three. Yet like in Melbourne 2, he seemingly has shown a refreshed mind to fight for every match and confidence to win it. After a tight 1st Set and an IMO horrendous 2nd Set -- not sure what happened to Stan on that one -- he had to work hard to try and win this and as we know mentally it can be draining. But Stan looked steely even when down 0-2 and trusted his game will stabilize. He broke Fuscovics early in the Sets he won which gave him confidence and momentum. IMO if Stan broke early in the 5th Set too I think he may have won that very likely. My faith that Stan could have surprise run is waning because while his game seems to have patches of being back to Top 5 level his mentality seems to revert back to pre-Magnus Stan -- just not confident enough to close matches."
1062,"I saw earlier that MattRacquet locked his twitter account at some point today and I immediately thought it had to be because of this, or possibly a Novak-adjacent take that sorta triggers people even though his assessments always seem pretty carefully considered not to attack anyone. Now I'm really curious.

In any case, I never really notice the time elapsed on serve. In fact, what I notice the most is commentators noting how completely aware players are of the clock ... and taking the full 25 seconds. Imo the shot clock crap pulls me out of the match action; it doesn't streamline it. It becomes a thing for comms to point out and then it becomes a Thing I wouldn't really be thinking about otherwise. 

This might be one of the rare times that being an American tennis fan lends perspective on international sport rather than warps it. Major League Baseball has imposed a similar time limit on pitchers to ""speed up the game"" (never mind that American football games run *just* as long on stop-and-start action, but feature the skull-bashing that presumably holds attention). Baseball is slow on like a cosmic, existential level. Either you're down with it or you're not. I appreciate that about it the way I appreciate Rafa's serve routine. It's an endearing feature and not a bug."
1063,"I honestly don't get why the media still talks about this guy non-stop and why people still say he's one of the most ""talented"" player ever when his results clearly show otherwise.

\- He hasn't made a Quarterfinals at a major in 6 years

\- He's never been ranked inside the top 10

\- He's never won a title above 500-level

\- He's never made the semifinals at a major

\- He's never qualified for the Year-end championship

\- He hasn't made it to the Quarterfinals at event above 500-level in 3.5 years

\- He's currently ranked behind players like Bublik, Pella, and Ramos-Vinalos (players who no one besides the die-hard tennis fans has ever heard of)

His ""talent"" has produced no results on the games biggest stages, and because of that, nothing he says about other players (who have all accomplished more than him) matters because he doesn't have the pedigree for people to take him seriously anyways. I thought he was an interesting addition to the tour at first but his behavior has become disgraceful for a grown-ass man and he's become a cancer to the ATP Tour. I can't remember a player still getting so much headlines despite producing such mediocre results.

His comments about players like Nadal, Djokovic and even Zverev mean about as much as a third-string quarterbacks comments on Tom Brady"
1064,"[https://ausopen.com/match/2021-su-wei-hsieh-vs-sara-errani-ws309](https://ausopen.com/match/2021-su-wei-hsieh-vs-sara-errani-ws309)

Errani battled so hard to have come marginally short. Total points won tied at 116 each, as well as break points 9-for-19 each!

Duel of the server's power outage, haha! Both won majority share of return points."
1065,I think djokovic has a harder draw than rafa. I feel like rafa's pace is still a bit too much for tsitsi / med but a zverev / thiem who are   online for an entire set can give even djokovic a bit of trouble. There's also wawrinka to worry about.
1066,"Just some recent examples:

1. Adria Tour. Djokovic organised a charity match and strictly followed the advice of the Croatian government. Yes it is unfortunate that people got infected but shouldn't the public be angry at the government then?
2. Djokovic's ""demands"" for the AO. As it turns out, they weren't even demands but rather suggestions and they were for players stuck in Melbourne, not for him personally in Adelaide. Disgusting Australian media essentially lied calling them demands making it seem he was ""demanding"" this for himself, and the gullible Australian public ate it up with the rest of the tennis community.

Not once did I see Roger or Rafa suggesting anything that can improve the lives of lower ranked players, but probably because the current status quo benefits them greatly and Djokovic's committee really doesn't.

Someone posted a detailed explanation a few years back or so and I remember big point was he's actually loved in Asian countries, but the Ango sphere not as much as Eastern Europe has always been ""the enemy"". 

All in all it seems people simply don't like Djokovic for some reason and use any excuse to essentially pile on him."
1067,"I think it's insane that people are discrediting Shapo for fighting through it and coming on top and boiling it down to Sinner not being fit as the only reason he lost. Can we stop treating 19 yr olds as if they were 35? In and out week by week recovery is possible and it was done by all the pros in previous eras, just because the emphasis on slam prep has grown doesn't mean that one can't possibly play a late tournament and then show up for a slam the week after (mind you, same venue, no travel, no jet lag). Sinner got outplayed by Shapo and they're both incredible talents who gave us an amazing R1."
1068,Lmao idk what y'all think the word nonchalant means but this isn't it. Y'all gotta stop with the kyrgios obsession. It's almost as cringey as Nick's novak obsession except Nick actually correctly identifies Novak as an excellent tennis player who is a bad role model bc the only thing he's nonchalant about is parties during a pandemic.
1069,"Monfils' comments translated to English:

""I'm in a nightmare that I'd like to get out but I can't. I am playing terribly. I can't serve. I can't make a forehand. I make mistakes. I am pushed 6 metres behind \[the baseline\]. I put on tarpaulins. I have no confidence. I don't feel good and it shows. I feel judged. I am already on the ground,  \[the media\] shoots me. I ask for clemency. It hurts me because I work hard. You can see that I can't do it. I train like a butcher and it doesn't work. When a guy is down, don't shoot him.""

When asked about what he clings to in moments of doubt, he gets emotional with this answer: 

""\[I cling\] to nothing. I will give my mother's simple sentence. She's going to tell me \[starts crying\]... she tells me 'we must continue to train and it will come back, this is the only trick'.""

Pretty awful how low Monfils must be feeling now."
1070,"These were the most revealing and interesting numbers in the article for me:

>In most instances, a player's forehand is better than their backhand. One general way to look at who's controlling points is to simply look at a player's forehand-to-backhand ratio. Using the match-charting data in this five-year, hard-court sample, for instance, we see that while the average player hits a forehand 55.9% of the time in rallies, Federer is at 61.2%, Nadal 60.2%. Less successful players in the sample are primarily lower -- Francis Tiafoe is at 48.3%, John Millman 45.3%.

>Djokovic is at only 50.9%, and it couldn't matter less. In points featuring a backhand shot, players only win 48.6% of the time on average, but Djokvoic wins 54.5%."
1071,"Even Anna Kournikova made a major semifinal.

But in seriousness, I think he's got talent but not results. People find him interesting despite his results. Possibly more so because he isn't winning. I was at the USO and multiple people near me wanted to go see him play. Even though he's not my favorite, I can see why others find him entertaining."
1072,"Medvedev and Thiem look like they have the easiest paths to the semis. Schwartzman would have been tough if this was the French Open for Thiem, but it isn't so I don't expect Thiem to have any problems if he's 100%. And Medvedev doesn't have anyone who can trouble him until the semis in my opinion, Rublev does not match up well against him at all.

Big opportunity for those two, but then again this isn't a tournament being played under normal circumstances so anything could happen."
1073,"I always wondered why tennis was always so top heavy. There was point where first round loses would get 50k, while semi-finalist losers would get 900k. Tennis will only get better now because first round losers pocket a respectable amount of money. Also qualifiers now make what first round losers used to make. 

It's a radical change that's happening atm. For the longest time, tennis has had the widest pay gap. It was pretty ridiculous for a while."
1074,Looking forward to the AO over the next 2 weeks but also a little sad since I won't be able to watch most matches due to being at work. I've always been spoiled in the past since I was on school or work holidays and could spend most days watching whatever match I wanted. I'll just have to keep checking the results on my phone whenever possible
1075,"Hsieh is the unbothered queen. She will stare down rockets then calmly bat the ball back, right in the corner, where you have no chance in hell of reaching it. Her ability to interrupt the rhythm of top 10 players is sensational and truly unique."
1076,"Absolutely agree. I hope they don't have line judges at the US open as well because I'm tired of all the drama there. The ""out"" sound that they use at the AO sounds like a cat getting its tale stepped on though. MEOWOUT ! lol"
1077,"First set was fairly slow, same with his R1 against kukushkin, but thiem looked up to the task in the second, won like 13 points in a row i think in insane fashion.

Got insanely lucky with the net too, apologising like 10 times after one point when koepfer got pissed."
1078,"Ok- Ok this is going good. 
Wait. Yuki sees Tohru as what?.. bruh ok 
...then I guess Kyo and Tohru are a thing now?? 

Ngl Yuki’s perspective of Tohru is understandable based on his upbringing and desperation to feel parental love but also completely unexpected.

[The series science consultant had some info about this](https://twitter.com/CDCubed/status/1031565796189843456)

>Yes, boiling bleach is dangerous. Don't do it. But! This talks about boiling bleach (NaClO) with added plant material, which changes everything. The presence of amines and ammonia (NH3, from the nitrogen cycle) in plants yields different reactions entirely.
Instead of chlorine gas (Cl2), you get chloramine (NH2Cl) and/or chlorine dioxide (ClO2), which aren't nearly as deadly (but still...please use proper ventilation).

Nevertheless, if you really want to try it yourself, just use baking soda or something not as dangerous instead."

1086,"I’m in the minority here, but I just don’t see it. Perhaps it’s because the motherly figure in my life wasn’t very motherly. I understand what the film tried to convey, but it just didn’t reach me. Anyone else feel the same?"
1087,"Is it just me who thinks that fights between side characters are sometimes better than the main character fighting as the side characters might not have plot armour and could die, therefore there is actual risk for them. Just me? Thought I would ask."
1088,"For me it's the goodbye kiss Nezumi and Shion share at the end of no. 6 because it's one of my favourite anime and I love those two characters together. It was bittersweet and emotional because you know they love each other and cant be together but the tender kiss and Nezumi saying ""You'll be just fine Shion""  cemented the hope that they may be reunited one day. I just think sad kisses and moments are more memorable and powerful. Also the scene where Nezumi and Shion dance together is my favourite romantic moment of any anime...I adore it so much."
1089,"Anybody ever wonder how the fuck everyone keeps predicting everyone else’s next move? Tsukasa be like “Your next line will be “Imma make a fucking steam engine”” and then senkus just like “I outsmarted your outsmarting by anticipating that you’d anticipate I’d make a steam engine” like how in the telepathic plot convenient fuck 
I still love this episode though"

1091,"One idea you could do is to alternate between them every three months (AKA every season of anime) and each season you also watch the shows from the previous season that were on that service. If that's too much of a hassle and you also can't afford to subscribe to both, then I'd say subscribe to Funimation and watch Crunchyroll with a free account. Funimation is cheaper per month ($6 compared to $8) and Crunchyroll has more of its library available on a free account rather than locked behind premium.

Also, if you live in the United States, look into VRV instead of Crunchyroll. VRV combines the anime libraries of Crunchyroll and HiDive under one site, which would normally cost $13 separately but instead costs $10 through VRV. If VRV is an option, then neither Crunchyroll nor HiDive are worth subscribing to by themselves."
1092,"Neither... the manga gets pretty generic and boring in my opinion and is effective the only manga I have ever dropped reading( granted I don’t read a whole lot of manga) and apparently the anime does it worse( I haven’t watched the new season).

By all means read the manga if you want to continue the story"

1096,"4Kids Yu-Gi-Oh.

Seriously, I listened to the Singaporean Dub that's closer to the Japanese version and while Yami sounds like a Surfer, that doesn't bother me, what bother me is the stuff I see that I assume came from the Japanese intent. Like there's a lot of evil characters that just say they're evil, but in the 4Kids dub they say things that describe them being evil like they would say ""This isn't about money, I made so much money, I could have retired years ago, I just like doing this"" and they would edit lines that would add more suspense.

4kids was a very good localization company, even they hated censorship. Network censors didn't like games of death, so they 4kids was like ""So we can't have games of death, but we can have games of teleportation to a world described like hell just as long as we call it 'the shadow realm'?"". 4Kids only real blunder was One Piece, they did a good job even with Shaman King, sure they replaced revolvers with flint locks, but even if they kept revolvers, there was more spooky things they left in like almost ripping a soul from a body.

Seems legit!"
1097," Arrow and Shu’s plan to help the bishounen, makes me wonder if Shu is doing something similar with Kai. Shu in the last episode made a point of telling Kai “Your biggest enemy is Back Arrow” after Kai says Shu is his enemy, seemingly trying to create a rivalry between the two, maybe trying to strengthen Kai’s Unrivaled conviction with an adversary that has incredible potential like Arrow. It seems mutually beneficial since Arrow is able to pick up techniques on the fly, like how he did his own version of Kai’s hand energy beam supposedly after seeing him do it.

Considering the bombs used in Shu’s defection and bluff on Kai, I wonder if this Minister Kyo had a part in it since Kai mentioned he is in charge of weapons development and he seemed to give Ren a three day reprieve. Kai also calls him a self preserving slimeball so that would give him a motive to help Shu defect, since now he has a higher position as Head Diviner. Also, his character design has a similar hat to Shu’s possibly implying a connection between the two, sort of like how Shu and Ren have those green belts.

Dr Sola seems to have some connection to Lutoh and given how they value intelligence that would explain his knowledge of the technology of this world. That would mean the main characters acquired allies from the two major factions."
1098,"Jeez, just how many dead Red Blood Cells are we going to see in this body? And then it got progressively worse (especially the part where they were trying to drag the bodies out of that big Katamari ball of bodies).

It sounds like the body is stuck at office work 24/7 and has to drown himself in caffeine to stay up, with dramatically bad effects on the body.

The drinking has gotten so bad that the liver can't maintain the glitz and the glamour anymore, and poor Hepatocyte is barely keeping herself up. At least Red Blood Cell was concerned about the girls.

Wow, those jerk Red Blood Cells basically committed attempted murder. I can't deny they didn't get what was coming to them, but I guess for them it was a relief to finally be done with this body.

The lungs get caught off from oxygen and the Red Blood Cells have to trek through a tight alley to deliver a smidgen of oxygen, but it ends up being what saves the body. For once Cell ingenuity manages to save the day.

It's become clear now that Red Blood Cell and White Blood Cell both see themselves as important to each other, and that their individual work helps inspire and drive the other to continue pushing onward within this difficult to manage body.

We saw White Blood Cell with her gal pals at the start of the episode, but now she seemingly can't find any more of her sister White Blood Cells in the body. Has the corps been thinned to such an extent that there are barely any in the body? Will White Blood Cell end up being the only one of her kind left?"

Hey guys need help deciding what anime would I enjoy, So.. I have watched around 6 series as of now which are AoT (upto the latest ep), HxH, DBZ, Death Note, Naruto/Boruto and Pokemon.

1101,"
This is a copy of my previous comment in other topic. I think it's suitable for this discussion.

Many of Chinese feminists didn't know neither anime nor Lex. And jobless reincarnation had already caused arguments and debates even before LEX's stream. Because LEX is famous on BILIBILI, after his disputed stream, many we media reported it. So feminists began to watch the anime and attack it. It's more like LEX incident let them know the anime. They didn't attack it before because they didn't know it. Feminist movement in China , especially in weibo, is quite different from that in the western world. it's crazy, disastrous, and not logical.

Anyway, China mainland version Mushoku Tensei won't come back to Bilibili. This anime has been corrupted by the fanatical feminists and Lex fans.They posted a lot of false ""truth"" on different sites. Now outside Bilibili, people really believe ""this anime is a bad anime which contains contents insulting women and teach children bad things"", and ""Lex is being treated unjustly"". Moreover, any anime fan who say supporting words for Mushoku Tensei outside Bilibili will be attacked immediately, especially on weibo. Bilibili has also announced they won't disrespect any group, which is regarded as a compromise with fanatical feminists."
1102,"It's alot of different aspects.

For me, I love the premise for starters. I love that the show isn't just dudes killing titans, that it's actually got an intriguing story and mystery and the show does alot of good world building. As the show progresses, you learn more, but also have more questions and it keeps things interesting. The action is phenomenal. The characters, music, and writing are also really stellar.

1107,"Excluding mobile games:

The Naruto Ninja Storm series was pretty good and they came out a bit before the anime fighting game market was oversaturated with arena fighters. I have fond memories playing Revolution and 4. 

Dengeki Bunko Fighting climax was a nice 2D fighter. The sprites aged well and it was diverse. Even though I was never good at it, it was fun playing a fighting game with Kirito in it.

Dragon Ball FighterZ is what I hoped every anime game would look like. Arc sys really mastered blending the anime style with video games. It’s a shame bamco just makes crappy arena fighters now. 

The SAO gameverse in general is pretty nice. Even though they aren’t as good as they *could* be, they’re a fun series for SAO fans. Them being non canon allows the games to be somewhat fresh and as fanservicey as they want. 

The Attack on Titan games were really good even though they were repetitive. Swinging around was a lot of fun and they were the equivalent of modern Spider-Man games (until Spider-Man ps4 came out)."

Bakemonogatari (and the rest of the Monogatari Franchise) has some great tsundere romance moments, though it's not really the focus of the series as a whole.

Kaguya-Sama and Baka and Test are more comedic takes on the genre that have some great tsundere moments too.

Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works has a top tier Tsundere if you're okay with big fight scenes and an overly complicated plot.

Another thing I love about this episode and its focus on Midori’s struggles is that it’s still an extension of [previously established](https://i.imgur.com/CZ2B8W5.png) character [traits/flaws](https://i.imgur.com/XutC2q4.png), but at the same time a completely separate issue from her earlier/ongoing anxiety over Tamako and Mochizou. I can see some complaints about teasing or not properly wrapping things up, but Midori’s story and character is largely an implicit and relatively vague affair. Taking the time to flesh her character out in a different dimension, though rooted in things we’ve previously seen, [Spoilers?](/s ""and not using the crutch of romance for dramatic tension"") is extremely valuable in my opinion.

Random Thoughts:

There are a number of [static background shots](https://i.imgur.com/pCuKBob.png) while characters talk. I’m not sure if someone could read into them as adding meaning or tone, but I at least liked the sense of space they provide.

[This parallel](https://i.imgur.com/vHItXLq.png) is beautiful.

Lots of emotion and character from everyone, too.

1128,"It's not normal to have erotic thoughts regarding minors, and even less to think ""mmh yes, 7yo girl, the best kind, can't wait to marry her, Imma cuddle my pillow tonight thinking of her. I am 40 in my head btw"".  
He doesn't hold himself back, he stalks Lilia with a panty on his face, stalk Roxxie when she undresses, openly look under her dress, steals Roxxie's panty and make it a god damn fetish and as I said he is so horny for a 7yo girl he has to sexually cuddle his pillow.  


Regarding the other characters, they all are really great. I just found the latest ep disturbing regarding the behaviour of Lilia towards Paul when they were talking about Rudy's future.  
Incredible animation, good music, bright colors, amazing artstyle, very nice. I will keep watching hoping for Rudeus to stop being a trash human and because of the production value.  
IMO, they just need to get rid of his ""otaku"" voice, I can't appreciate a character if he appears as an empty shell controlled by a 40yo pervert, I want Rudeus to think with his Rudeus voice."
1129,"With the hair tug meme in full force you'd think society would return to normal but because of clingy drunk office ladies we still have kill counts rising. Gyuk! Passer by Parasyte looked like a Rick and Morty chara... This is horrid. Do you know how much time I spent trying to defend the hair pulling thing yesterday? You can't just prove its a design failure in the pre-op scene like this!

As if you needed anymore proof that Kana lives in a fcking fairy world. Erm... Wut? That Pony is hideous!! What is this ridiculous shite? Hold off the cheese before bed Kana. THAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE SHINICHI!! Yeah, you'd better hang your head after that one. I'm dying from second hand cringe.

Looks like Kana's arc is finally here, probably? This was why I was scared of the JK's making me bald. Dude, don't pocket it! Shinichi flips at her threatening to tear the remaining hair off the other poor sods she senses. Poor Murano has become the third wheel cause of this Parasyte perv... It's tough to pass the Bechtel test when literally all your female characters are man eaters.

""Could this woman be one of *my people*?"" Sorry, you're the only one with whack fantasies. Kana has some nerve cheering her on when she's the one trying to steal her boyfriend. Wait your turn Nugget! You're a shit human being... Oh my bear~ Oh my christ! He just splatted Nita's head! The dude looks so dumb yet so terrifying! He's scarier than the other Parasytes and he hasn't even transformed! He's just a force of nature. Urgh... So our next villain is a Bane parasyte that is not only a juggernaut in combat but can easily switch hosts. Scary!

Good on you sticking with best girl for your date! Forget the juggernaut, that toy is the scariest part of the show! Hah? Don't repeat anything Mugi says to you. It makes you look like a psycho. Do you ever feel like you just picked the wrong choice in a VN? Murano too, she does know that his mum died on that trip yeah? What a cute dog, let's bin it! I'm starting to get second thoughts on this pairing.

""Stop crying or you're getting the leek!"" Smack that shit like a Ken Akumatsu manga! Kana smells her target and is on the prowl. Did you really have to ruin their first kiss by making it about nugget? Oh shut up Murano. Oh shut up! XD Oh my god, you too Kana! Eight Parasytes in office, and they're environmentalists too!

""My last request... Say, how are you with tights and horses?"""
1130,"Fairy tail - the anime where nobody dies, but every fight they claim they are sacrificing their lives. 

Legit final arc of fairy tail. Every good main character at some point *fake dies* and just comes back perfectly fine . Not even long term repercussions.

-Snow White with the Red Hair: didn't think I'd get so into this show but I love all the characters, like there's no bad character in this show??

-Kono Oto Tomare Sound of Life: this was always on my recommended list on Hulu but didn't think about starting until I randomly decided to one day. I ended up really enjoying it!

-Attack on Titan: I'm usually really bad with violence so I avoided watching it, but with all this s4 hype I wanted to hop on and omg I binged it in like 4 days...so good..."

They turned Reki into a doormat whose only purpose is to lose and make the opponents look good. Langa somehow picks everything up instantly and constantly wins.

I remember that it was about this girl at this all-girls school that had a boys school by it, though that isn't important. A new male teacher came and started turning the girls into vampires eventually they turned on him and killed him. If I'm remembering correctly, it was  a series, but it might have been a movie. It had a darker, more mature tone and was really good. Any help in finding it would be much appreciated."
1139,"Because it ended six months ago.

1143,"I respect how they did this episode, even if some of the emotional punches were a bit less than in the manga. For those wondering, this episode was basically 5 chapters long, but each chapter of course focused on one of the Nakanos throughout the term. They'd end each chapter showing that sister's score. The 5th chapter was a bit different, but we'll leave that aside for now.

Some minor things were cut or streamlined along the way, but that's alright. I really do love that they knew the major things to focus on, especially the Ferris wheel scene. To me, that was one of the biggest moments of the series when I first read it. It made seeing Yotsuba's score at the end of that chapter all that more tear-jerking, so showing her happiness first was great here as well.

And what a great way to end the episode. I CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK, BEGIN THE OFFENSIVE!"

1149,"Miku is cute but I dislike that she has to rely on her sisters so much to try and convey feelings for Futaro. I also think she misunderstands him. He definitely sees Itsuki as a woman, for example, and I'd argue the same goes for Ichika. His relationships with each of them are just different. I would say he sees himself on more or less equal footing with Ichika(I think he'd at the very least consider an immediate relationship with her if she confessed), a good friend to Itsuki and Yotsuba, a mentor to Miku, and on uneven ground with Nino still. 

Now to preface what I'm about to say, I'm enjoying this and I don't think this is a bad thing, but.. this race isn't fair from the start. Ichika has a massive head start by the nature of being the provider for them and presenting herself to Futaro as a mature figure, which he can relate to, Futaro already knows Nino would fall for him if they were to start over/knows she is currently struggling with feelings for him she isn't sure she wants, he has by far the best chemistry with Itsuki and is probably closest to her overall, and then there's Yotsuba and Miku. I think he respects Yotsuba's drive and there is potential there, but he genuinely seems so oblivious to Miku's obvious feelings that it may as well be on purpose. 

Obviously Eatsuki best girl, but based on how the story has gone so far Ichika would have an easy win if she would just confess."

We already know that bullying is common at St. Lucia, so I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen.

1158,"> Is it because the production staff knows that there won't be a continuation and this will be the final season so they wanted to go anime original to wrap things up?

That's what I'd assume. They probably think doing something original would work better than trying to smash an adaptation of everything left into one 12-episode season."
1159,"Mecha are usually anime original productions. Shounen is a demographic of manga, which is based on what magazine the manga is published in. Therefore the vast majority of mecha aren't shounen. There's exceptions of course, but there's just as many if not more that are seinen instead.

What mecha have you been trying? The genre has some extremely low lows, and some very high highs."
1160,"Cicadas, I hear cicadas, lots of cicadas.

Why cant Satoko tell Rika she is having problems.  Surely Rika would help her. Why can't Rika figure out, even with Satoko telling her, that there is a big problem. Why doesn't Rika find time for some one-on-one talks.

Watching them work together to study for the test was so sweet.  Why has Rika failed to remember that she needs to not just go to St. Lucia's together with Satoko, but also to protect her there (and thus protect herself)?  How can Rika retain her past memories yet be so poor in processing them?"

My guess is that, following the poor reception of the Manga, they were only given 12 episodes to wrap the whole series up, and had to chainsaw most of the Manga to reach some ending, probably, with a skeleton team, since Cloverworks is doing 2 more series this season (I think?).

I'm pretty sure I already discussed the same thing that I picked my last rewatch since it feels straightforward but still a nice episode about Midori trying to save face.

She's the captain so she thinks she has to do the heavy carrying, but forgets she can always rely on her friends and teammates until she cracks and starts crying while trying to keep a happy face. I think it is nice how much Tamako and Kanna know Midori, being able to tell something is wrong from her minor changes in behavior. All of it concluding in the heartwarming hug scene and montage of them preparing for the festival.

I think there was lots of visuals this episode though, particularly the facial expressions, especially noticeable in the [crying scene](https://i.imgur.com/5qj2ptF.jpeg) and the [happy](https://i.imgur.com/uuHECP5.jpg) scene. So while it isn't a necessarily deep episode, it comes with minor visuals that pack lots of emotional impact.

1186,"Interesting, every single anime score has dropped quite a bit since last year. Even for older series like Clannad and LOTGH (This score was 9.03 to 9.10 to 9.07 fulctuates often - probably because it has less members).

I wonder why that is

I see movies aren't added. Your Name has had a huge drop in score the last year. Especially for something with 1.6 Million members it moves fast.

Some critisism:

You should take in account that when sequels that have a worse score than their prequel, they aren't very good.

Fans keep watching sequels after season 1 and rate it high, while the people who think it's average don't watch the prequel at all. This results in sequels almost always having (much) higher scores.

If the sequel has a negative score in comparison to the prequel, the sequel is probably not that good.

An example is Hajime no Ippo season 3 (5th on your list) which is rated 0.07 lower than season 2. I actually rated season 2 an 8/10 but had to drop season 3 and rated it 5/10 after 17/25 episodes.

We are seeing this with bleach. I don't hear positive things about the bleach ending but we have another season. Didin't read past the anime, just saying this is what i hear.

It had soldiers in red uniforms being fed to monsters and it was something about monsters i remember the aesthetic reminded of me the 1800s but i don't remember the name and am having a hard time finding the show.

The 2nd i watched a bit of when i was little and i only remember bits and pieces it was played on teletoon network during the night if i remember rightly. What i specifically remember was the plot involved earth being shattered and now everyone lived on floating island and the protagonists were living with their mom on a homestead when the antagonists in a gunship show up asking for them cause their dad did something for the government and the plot up to that point was them being chased by the army and their mom died or was imprsoned."
1201,"A little bit of background: I'm not a fan of heavy themed/ecchi/seinen stories. When my friend recommended me to watch Mushoku Tensei I just ignored it and took his other recommendations instead. I prefer more lighthearted anime like K-On, Kanata no Astra, and Mairishimashita Iruma-kun!, which I think is one of the better isekai series out there.

So I heard the news about Bilibili and its drama revolving around the show, so I'm curious. What is it about the show that makes people upset? So I checked it out. 

As of this writing I have watched all 5 episodes, and I'm so disappointed. 

About the excessive backlash, that is. 

In my opinion, Mushoku Tensei is a really good coming-of-age ecchi seinen story about a man with no hope left being reincarnated into a brand new world where he can live properly once again. Alternatively, it's a story of a man ridden with mental illness being put into rehabilitation as he slowly tries to become better.

It's not as bad as some people put it out to be. 

Here is what I gathered about the show:

A.) The MC in his previous life was a 34 year old hopeless hikkikomori who never accomplished anything his life. In other words, he never really matured mentally. In fact he got even worse, because he is incredibly perverted and based on what I saw in episode 2, he's also a lolicon. 

In other words, he was a disgusting human being and I have every right to dislike him. Even still, he's a product of fiction. I loathe him, but not too much I wanna slander/cancel the show for me to be at peace lol. 

B.) He reincarnated, then during his childhood he pondered about his pointless past life and promised himself that he'll live to the fullest using this second life. However, his erotic thoughts still remain throughout the show. That's not a bad thing in my opinion, since regardless of whether he's reincarnated or not, it's normal to have erotic thoughts. He's self-aware of what actions are immoral and tries to hold himself back from doing it. That's enough for me. He just wants to live, have crushes, make mistakes and learn lessons like normal people do. 

C.) The characters are very colorful. What I mean by that is they have good sides and bad sides. They can be righteous and oftentimes, be petty. They can be supportive and oftentimes, be horny. This show reeks of cognitive dissonance. And I actually love it. You can find any flaw with each character that some people may not agree with, and that's okay. 

As the protagonist, the viewers can peer into his thoughts, and it is unsettling to read him like an open book. However, these characters are a very good representation of real people in my opinion. Some people with a pretty good public reputation could have some fucked up taboo fantasies in their head and we'll never know about it because not once they ever acted on it. We all have our own secrets and thoughts we don't want to share to others no matter what. The only difference is that these characters' secrets and thoug"

Kinda glad they really went with a more dangerous route this episode. There are dangers and coming from a country with tropical climate, I would’ve never thought about how dangerous the cold can be. Even draining your phone’s battery life ? Yikes. But good sense comes from bad experiences. I’m sure the girls will take this lesson with them going forward.

Oh dear, what a massive episode today.

-----

How many different ways can you spell out a complete and utter destruction like that?  Was it the way Saint Snow lit up the stage and proved they outclassed Aqours?  Was it the fact they got dead last in the competition?  Or was it the big fat zero that showed that even if they didn’t show up to the competition, nothing would matter?  I think if it was only one or two of these things, it would have shown that *something* they were doing was right, that something was worth salvaging from the wreck.  “Saint Snow is in another league, but there are other people who support what we are doing, so let’s keep at it!”  “We may have gotten zero votes, but so did other groups.  That just shows how hard this is, so let’s keep at it!”  “We may have gotten dead last with zero votes, but I don’t see Saint Snow as better than us.  We will prove that our way is better!”

The reality is that all three things happened, and it is essentially the largest middle finger that anyone has ever received in this franchise.  Well, there’s one more in this episode that is even bigger, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.

Saint Snow functions as our rivals for Aqours.  Just like A-RISE was to ?’s, Saint Snow is an ideals check to Aqours.  They have a head to head today, even if Aqours’ performance was offscreen.  Saint Snow performed the song [SELF CONTROL](https://love-live.fandom.com/wiki/SELF_CONTROL!!#English), while we can assume that Aqours performed [Yume de Yozora o Terashitai](https://love-live.fandom.com/wiki/Yume_de_Yozora_o_Terashitai#English) due to their outfits being the same as the ones they used in Episode 6.  Because there is a lot to talk about today, I think the lyrical analysis is best left to those people already doing it (though I don’t think there are any), or you can read the lyrics for yourself and come to your own conclusions.  But as for what I think, the relevant TL;DR portion for the rest of this review is that Aqours’ song closely aligns with the legacy of ?’s, while Saint Snow’s song can be viewed as a rejection of it.

Knowing this, alongside the trainwreck that was the competition results, basically means that everything, and I do mean *everything*, Aqours has been doing up to this point has been wrong.  Aqours with their “be like ?’s” story versus Saint Snow’s mantra of power through suppression of feelings.  Saint Snow may not have won the competition, but the results show that they’re doing something right.  And thus in the battle of ideals, Saint Snow wins, and it wasn’t even close.

“If you’re trying to get to Love Live like ?’s did, you might as well give up now.”  “This isn’t a game.”  It stings because if we’re being honest here, I don’t think Chika was messing around either.  To be accused of not taking something seri"

**Pop Team Epic** constantly made me ask ""wtf is this?!"" and why would anyone like this, and ""fuck you"" for making me watch this twice, for no good reason.  Again, it would appear that a lot of that was on purpose.

1214,"Why. Just why. When watching AOT on funimation for most seasons you have the option of watching the simulcast which is what is given to them at first and broadcasted on TV with restrictions and then theres the uncut version which is supposed to be the Blu-ray or like it says, ""uncut"" version of the show with no TV restrictions.

Yet for season 1, only the uncut version is avaible and they STILL censor it. Im currently re-watching AOT and this is my first time watching it on funimation. Ive come across that scene on ep 6 where Armin comes across Hannah giving Franz CPR. Its supposed to be ""uncut"" yet they still showed the TV version of that scene rather than the ""uncut""/blu-ray version which shows Franz's guts.

Anyone know why they do this???"
1215," So I just finished Claymore, i loved the show but the ending got me hurting because that wasnt a way to end things. So just look through my list and tell me what to watch! Or you can tell me whats not in my list but you may think i like! (I will add that my rankings on my MAL are because i havent watched anything I hated. I have either loved it or was meh with it)

1217,"Well so I know that this anime is based on the game and the answer arcs are present in the second season. But the thing is something doesn't make sense in the question arc also.

In episode 8 after keichi was stabbed and ended up at the hospital and Mion(who was actually shion) was found dead due to falling from her building, it is shown that at the ending one of the sonozaki sisters spawn at the hospital room of keiichi and was going to stab nails in his hands.

But when things start getting clear in the ""Eye Opening"" chapters that actually it was Shion disguised as Mion all along, at the end of episode 21(chapter 6) it was shown that Shion killed mion and after she stabbed Keiichi(thought he died) and was going back to her apartment, fell from the balcony and died. So if both the sonozaki sisters died then the appearance of one of the sonozaki twins at the end of episode 8 doesn't make sense.

Please let me know. Thanks."

1219,"For those wanting to run the gauntlet of worst anime ever, the MAL link is here:

[Top Anime (11000 - ) - MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php?limit=11000)

If you cant even be bothered to do that the bottom 5 are as follows:

1. [Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven - MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3287/Tenkuu_Danzai_Skelter_Heaven)

5. [Kokuhaku - MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31634/Kokuhaku)

Interestingly, Ex Arm, which only came out in January of this year, has already cemented itself as the third worst anime of all time, even beating the infamous masterpiece that is Mars of Destruction.  That's quite the feat. They could even use that in it's marketing and turn in into 'The Room' of anime."
1220,"Every anime on MAL I have rated 10/10 is a real, honest 10/10. Except for A Certain Scientific Railgun. **It is a 13/10**. I love the power system, the world, the characters, the story, the humor, the art style, the voice actors. To be clear, I am not saying Railgun is the best anime of all time. To be honest, I have a hard time reccomending it to most people. I am only saying it is the best anime of all time ***for*** ***me***."
1221,"I know there are a lot of discussions about many different animes on this sub-reddit, but I'm also sure that there are some that almost never get talked about, like Kiznaiver, even though quite a few of us have watched them. So I'm curious, what anime have you watched in your life time, and what would be your top 3?"
1222,"I've always thought Code Geass is garbage. I'd be hard pressed to say I disliked it outright, though. That feeling of knowing what the anime wanted me to feel but experiencing the polar opposite so vividly was exciting in it's own right.

I was dying laughing at every scene with an air of sincerity, from the very first episode where LeLouch's intellect is conveyed through a vague chess metaphor and they proceed to try and apply this metaphor to an actual fucking battle field like it makes any amount of sense. The ""Euphemia Moment"" is quite possibly the hardest I've laughed at a show.

In contrast, I was deadpan during every attempt at a joke and I thought the fights were boring."

But as a side note on your objections. If you don't like a type of content that's 100% your choice. There are so many alternatives that I think you'll be able have a good time with something.

1231,"Tsubasa Chronicles and xxxHolic.

They should also air during the same season OR rotate each season. The reason for this, is that the stories of these 2 manga are connected.

1232,"If I get cheat powers, I'd probably still try to stay in the background. Can't be bothered to be an adventurer as it's basically a merc company with less benefits and no negotiating power.

The problem with the worlds of most isekai power fantasies is that they're too focused on the power aspect of their magic systems while I'm far more interested in the utilities aspect of it. Like a world with fire magic is often focused on making the biggest explosions for war where as I'm more interested in society can use fire magic for stuff like power generation or refinement.

You know what, fuck it. If I get isekaied I want to be known as the guy who started the first firefighting service in that world. I'd perfect water magic to figure out how to put out fires most efficiently with the least amount of collateral damage and mana spent, and then sell an insurance policy to put out fires for houses that were insured. I'll make my thesis around optimal fire fighting with water magic and accidentally revolutionize warfare in my quest for universal fire fighting."
1233,"So the sub I was watching used perseverance for ??. Is perseverance really the skill that kumo got? Because I understand chinese(kanji) and ?? actually means patience, which is quite a bit off from perseverance.

Also kumo got more taboo level for perseverance plus perseverance is another ruler title. Pride being 7sin is obvious, doesn't that mean kumo likely got a skill from the counterpart of 7sin(7virtues) given taboo is being triggered again? I even suspect ? being wrath, tho the sub I watched used anger(close enough, unlike patience vs perseverance)

Can any source reader confirmed whether kumo has a perseverance skill or was it supposed to be patience? Both kanji and also the skill effect suggests it is patience, but on the other hand the skill description of ""surviving with 1hp as long as mp is available"" should by all means indicates perseverance."

The one thing that stuck out to me was the scene was Rika offering Satoko help. Satoko does her ""ojou-laugh"" and tries not to reveal her weakness before leaving and one of Rika's new friends comments on it being an ""unbecoming laugh."" It is clear that Satoko doesn't fit in with a school that is all about appearances and Rika is too happy with her new life to notice how much this is affecting Satoko. Poor Satoko.

Congratulations to those who last week managed to predict that Satoko will be able to get in to St. Lucia but essentially be an ""outcast"" within the school's cliques on top of her struggles to follow the academy's curriculum in contrast to Rika being able to fully enjoy her school life.

Well we know now its all going to be a downward slippery slope for Satoko's mental health culminating with probably Rika's death on her hands. Yet the biggest question will be how on earth can she looped back to Hinamizawa with Rika? Surely Hanyuu will not be the one responsible for that right?

[Umineko](/s ""Yes, it is most likely to be one of the witches' doing. But the question then switches to who? Personally I predict that Featherine is responsible. Simply because everything seems to play out based on the hints that we get from the opening sequence and she did appeared for a frame (others managed to point out that Satoko is wearing St. Lucia's uniform thus she must've enrolled in with Rika) meanwhile Lambda is never hinted, let alone seen anywhere in the entirety of the season.

1258,"What I like about this show is that even if it uses (or gets inspiration from) several popular animes everyone's watched (naruto, HxH, etc) it feels brand new. The characters are amazing, it's funny as fuck, the scripts and dialogues feel fresh, voice acting and animation are on another level. I can understand the hype behind this show, it is good."
1259,"I'm not a newbie to watching anime, I've actually been watching anime for at least 6 years by now and I've seen around 40 full animes in total. I want to watch a new series, but I can't find any animes that I would probably like. I like Hunter x Hunter, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One Piece, Bleach, Tokyo Ghoul, and The Promised Neverland (the manga gets a lot better). Can anybody give me some unpopular anime recommendations?  


EDIT: 40 animes was a bit of an exaggeration. More around 15 - 30."
1260,"This heavily depends on the show. Plot heavy shows I wouldn't recommend speedrunning it as the crutch depends on digesting it week to week(or at least somewhat)

Most shows I will say can be binged without consequence."

- Tatami Galaxy
- Shouwa Genroku Rakugo
- Mushishi
- Neon Genesis Evangelion

- March Comes in like a Lion
- Fruits Basket 2019
- Gankutsuou (haven’t watched it but I think this is exactly what you’re looking for)"

1263,"Who is uplifting this show as a philosophical masterpiece? Who sees any good in the show? In my opinion, the only reason people push this show is because it's ""eDgY"". 

Its just a hentai set in a broken world with an op pos protagonist who solves all his problems by raping people.

When I first heard about this show, all I heard was about how some American companies refused to take it because it was ""racy"" but I didn't know the ""raciness"" was just fucking rape. As soon as I found out they captured him because of his seamen, I legit thought ""there no way I can take this anime seriously""

I know his backstory, I know the same was done to him and that was fucked up but what he's doing is even more fucked up. And before someone says ""the villains were worse"" Yeah, thats the whole point. That's how the author justifies the rape. 

Also the magic system is more than broken, it's shattered. As a Healer, Kurenya (i don't remember who to spell his name) is able to teleport and reverse time. And he's able to steal experience? The fuck? Was that every even explained how the experience worked in their world and why they need to fuck him to do so?

Tl:dr - I don't like it, I despise it really and I don't understand why some people like it"

1265,"Just stick with it, it gets better and better with each episode. I stopped caring about it's shortcomings right about past episode 6. And it is worth the huge payoff.

As Gigguk said ""The ending is paramount.""

And this anime sticks the landing for it's ending perfectly."
1266,"I am relatively new to watching anime but I really would love some recommendations on what to watch. I really like physiological type things. I have finished Death Note which I absolutely loved, Hunter x Hunter, Attack on Titan, and One Punch Man. I’m currently watching re:Zero, Bleach, Tokyo Ghoul, Haikyuu, and Noragami. More things like AoT or Death Note is what I would really love!"
1267,"I'm actually really surprised. I was expecting to see the loop injection at the end of this episode, or evidence of manipulation, but it's looking more and more like Satoko herself deliberately asked for revenge based on miscommunicaiton.

I don't want to call this episode ""light"" but it certainty pushed back the timeline of answer content, with the loop injection in Episode 20, the Damashi answers in 21, and then only three episodes to solve the crisis."
1268,"Not watching dubs, so I can't comment on that one, but for English translated subs, it's much better to have the names not be translated, so they actually match what the character is saying. I don't really find names hard to remember at all.

Having the subs say ""Lana"" when someone is calling for ""Suiren"" in Pokemon Sun & Moon, would be really confusing...

PS: If I did watch dubs, I'd still prefer them to use their original names. Otherwise the names will often be all over the place, since ""the main character"" would probably still have their japanese name to fit with the title of the show (let's say Naruto), and it would feel really weird to hear Naruto yell ""Bob"" every time he called for Sasuke, or something like that."
1269,"Think the season will end at the tournament. Hoping we could see more of them but with what haikyuu did which is setting the bar higher, people won't be keen on a new season eventhough it's more drama based compared to sports based. And seriously, i want the people hating on this to know this is not haikyuu 2.0, and if it does go on season 2 and such, i see many potential in this series. Saying that, it likely won't happen, so gonna read up the manga after the last epi i guess."

I have already posted part 1 here and will post part 3 when I have finished editing it. But I am a little busy with uni stuff at the moment, so it might take some time. I will also post a full length video on my YouTube going through all 3 recipes in detail, as there are lots of small details I can't explain in these short videos.

If that interests you, [I'll leave a link to my YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ARVBW76xRweCmr6gsDzaw) :)

# Recipe (12 macaron hearts - 6 macaron sandwiches)

For the Macaron

\- 70g Ground Almonds

\- 65g Icing Sugar

\- 50g Egg White

\- 45g Granulated Sugar

&#x200B;

For the Genoise Sponge

\- 2 Eggs

\- 1/8 tsp Cream of Tartar

\- 75g Sugar

\- 25g Vegetable Oil

\- 40g Milk

\- 30g White Chocolate

\- 70g Plain Flour

\- ¼ tsp Baking Powder

&#x200B;

For the Raspberry Sauce

\- 40g Raspberries

\- 40g Water

\- 20g Sugar

\- ½ tsp Cornflour

# Method

For the Macaron

1. Sift together the ground almonds and icing sugar. Do not press through any large pieces, instead just discard them. If you have time, blend these ingredients in a food processor before sieving to ensure a super smooth surface on your macaron.
2. Whip up the egg whites until bubbly, then add in the sugar. Continue beating until soft peaks form.
3. Add a little of the dry ingredients to the egg whites and fold in, then add in the remaining dry ingredients and fold together. The Macaronage technique is about folding in the ingredients, but also about pressing out large air bubbles to obtain the correct texture. You are looking for it to resemble lava when it falls off the back of your spoon.
4. Pipe the macaron mixture into heart shapes on parchment paper. Bang the tray to settle the mixture and pop any large air bubbles. Then leave to form a skin. The time for this will vary depending on your climate, but you need to wait until you can run your finger over the top of the macaron without it sticking.
5. Once the skin has formed bake the macaron at 140°C for 14 minutes. Use a non-fan oven to prevent browning, as fan ovens may dry the macaron out and cause it to brown.

&#x200B;

For the Genoise Sponge

6) Separate the eggs into yolks and whites. Add the cream of tartar to the whites and whip up into soft peaks.

7) In a large bowl whip together the egg yolk and sugar until pale. Then add in the oil, milk and white chocolate. Whisk until combined.

8) Sift in the flour and baking powder, then gently fold everything together. Next, fold in the egg whites and transfer the mixture into an oiled baking tin/glass container. (Mine is about 15cm by 15cm by 10cm). Bake at 160°C for 40 minutes.

9) Once cooled, carve the cake as shown in t"

1275,"First Timer

Episode 19 - The lost, lost little 

Great start to the episode, little Manaka and little Chisaki are so cute, also Chisaki remembering that Hikari was always there for them was nice. Also Chisaki wearing her nurse outfit was beautiful to see. 

Hikari still loves Manaka, he tells her that he won't let go of her, Miuna listens and Chisaki sees that she also likes Hikari. Seeing Chisaki think about all the time that has passed and comparing to their ages was very melancholic and nostalgic for her. 

Tsumugu thanking Kaname for saving him in the night of the Ofunehiki was nice to see. Tsumugu says that he's glad that the guys came back from hibernating. 

Chisaki and Hikari passing time together was nice to see, the way he knew what to do after Chisaki told him the continuation of the Ojoshi's story that the old man has told her showee how much he believes in her words and encouragement.

Answers

1. It helped the sea god's tale to become a cohesive complete story

A girl competing for Student Council President that gives out blank check promises, sniffs the sweaty T-Shirts of her *kouhais* and yet friendly to all sports and other clubs!? And then always coming second in everything school and exams?

What a legend. And you are sadistic Aoi-chan, Tomozaki-kun is going to struggle lurking around her even if Mimimi ending up dumping him as election manager. It's really funny seeing all her election promises and elections rallies, she's surely going to have a real decent chance considering Aoi Hinami's rather conservative stance. If even Miko Iino had the chance to win it, Mimimi's definitely one candidate that can't be written off. Who knows, maybe Aoi-chan would be upset next episode and sending Tomozaki-kun a huge step closer to ""win the game"".

The entire story and premise is changed, literally everything is turned on its head. Its that kind of anime that will make you wonder how much of a protagonist Eren is, is what they are doing morally right etc.

I've watched most of the really high rated anime: Naruto, Death Note, Bleach and Hunter Hunter and I would put it up there.

I'm not saying go watch it but maybe try it again when you have nothing else to do."
1308,"I read this as a manga first before the anime and I prefer the manga more probably cause I can pace myself reading it better. I first caught interest of 3d kanojo cause the main character is basically a typical guy mc you'd expect from a shounen romance but 3d kanojo plays out more like a shojo romance. 

If you're not enjoying what you're watching then drop it. I'd really only recommend you to continue watching this if you want to know how it ends or if any of the characters interests you. (The characters do get development although it's slow)."
1309,"I was quite surprised satako made it the school. I thought the story was headed into the direction, where satako goes nuts after all her friends leave the village. So this was a nice twist!

So satako snapped because this type of life was never for her. She doesn't care about high-class society, nor studying for high grades. She just want to spend time with her beloved friend; rika. 

Unfortunately, she doesn't realize that it's time to grow up! They are approaching adult life, and Satako wants to stay a child. Also, Satako could've solved this issue if she just talked to rika. However, her narcissistic personality combined with her being a teenager, makes it hard for her to open her feelings. 


I loved the cikatada in the final scene symbolizing satako's recession into the virus. I never believed she was completely cured; it's always been a staple rule that nobody can truly recover from late stage hinazawa virus. 

Though, I wonder if that one umineko chick will show up and give satako her power next episode."
1310,"If someone gives a good argument for why they disliked/liked a series that I can understand, then it might change my opinion but at the end of the day my experience watching the series hasn’t changed, which is what matters to me"

1312,"I cosplayed this. I met some animators from studio Trigger and I got a free Cassette Girl artbook autographed on the Daicon page by the director and the character designer (for Cassette Girl) Shigeto Koyama and Hiroyasu Kobayashi. 

I have so many warm memories with this short now... mostly with meeting industry people. At con itself nobody recognized me until there was a new FLCL entry and I did Haruko cosplaying Daicon bunny and went to the Pillows concert. 

?? It really is the best.


COSPLAY ADVICE TO ANYONE CONSIDERING IT


If you choose to cosplay this, find someone who is willing to pick stuff up for you and set stuff down. You cannot bend forward. Sitting is a challenge. Avoid sitting on the floor. Consider bringing lots of stuff expecting a wardrobe malfunction of some kind. Be careful about raising your arms too highly and suddenly. Count on losing an inch (in your tits or stomach or both) walking around making it slightly looser than desired and bring someone who can sew you into the costume when necessary. Someone who can help you when you need to pee( i cannot get in and out of the costume alone). Don’t be afraid of stuffing. Even playboy bunnies must do this to keep boobs in place. Consider that this costume is not friendly to ANY bodytype.plan plan plan.

This was harder than my wedding dress to make. And harder than anything I have ever worn to wear.

Ps. To make easier consider not doing the low back. Consider straps."

1333,"The primary targeted audience for primetime TV is ages 18-49, which is what the Nielsen ratings primarily focus on.   A massive chunk of anime is targeted at 12-17.  It's not true for all anime, but most of it is in fact targeted at kids, just like American cartoons.  Here in the states, there are networks specifically aimed at entertainment for children (Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney), whereas anime is broadcast on their major networks on primetime (like our ABC/CBS/NBS/Fox networks).  Also, Fox's cartoon block on Sundays doesn't get nearly the kind of ratings that live action shows and reality TV shows get on other evening blocks, suggesting the market just for animated shows (even mature ones) just isn't as high as other shows because of the ""cartoons are for kids"" stigma.

Then there's also the fact that we live in a heavily conservative country where religion (specifically Christianity) rules the roost and a LOT of anime goes against their ""morals"" (while ignoring the fictional nature of it)... not to mention the groups of people who lean heavily the other way too (again, completely ignoring the fictional nature of it).  It took a long time for gaming to become mainstream, and since anime only*really* became truly popular in the last say... 10 or so years, I feel it'll be a while before it too is widely accepted."

That being said: It went downhill and turned into a harmless vanilla harem story after the first half of ep 3. I'm kind of disappointed. The main protagonist lost a lot of his craziness and vileness sadly."
1338,"Not nearly as tearjerky or hard-hitting as some of the other mentions but here are some romances that have drama elements to them:


A Whisker Away - A girl turns into a cat to spend time with her crush.


Her Blue Sky - A high school amateur musician deals with a manifested spirit of an old friend inhabiting her jamspace.


Ride Your Wave - Fireman and a surfer girl hit it off


And some dramas that have a romance element to them:


The Garden of Words - Rainy days bring a student and a teacher closer


5cm/s


Only Yesterday - A grown woman looks back at formative memories of her time as a child while on vacation to the countryside



If you find yourself searching for a lighter romance movie - I'd recommend ""I've Always Liked You"", it's short and pretty feel good."

Two different scenes of Ichika teasing Fuutarou about reading/thinking [something](https://imgur.com/0dSsbTO) [dirty](https://imgur.com/CbwDdvA)... Projecting a little, Ichika?

This was a sad episode for Miku; First with [the cooking](https://imgur.com/UICq0lx), and Nino who made fun of her (before realizing she was serious about it), and then with [the exam](https://imgur.com/rdyIP6I) she wanted to top score in, but didn't do it (even though she passed).

Well, while I felt a little sorry for Miku, as an Ichika fan I'm glad she got it! 

[Best girl, best score](https://imgur.com/rxEZASk), is there anything Ichika can't do? But best-girl-bias aside, it's quite impressive; Not only she's has a job on top of her studies, unlike her sisters, but it's a tough, non-conventional job, and she has to take parts she doesn't even want to support the other 4 girls... And despite all that, she had the top score. This was a nice feel-good moment! She really deserves good stuff happening to her, for how much she does for everyone! She's even [ruining herself](https://imgur.com/mjvL9Dc) for them.

She's even [supporting Miku](https://imgur.com/tYSIGYc) with Fuutarou, even though she has the same feelings for him. [Same as Nino](https://imgur.com/mtjMgXV); Helping Miku make some good chocolate, despite having feelings for him too (even if she's trying her best to deny them!)

[Yotsuba](https://imgur.com/VxNVYeN), [don't be so hard on yourself!](https://imgur.com/cXNP4t0) Well, with the way [Fuutarou always trash them](https://imgur.com/Qyd0d5x), can't blame her. At least this time it was in his thoughts, he didn't say it out loud!

I don't know if everyone got [this](https://imgur.com/rOAC4JS) [callback](https://imgur.com/jxhtCEm); I expected them to show a flashback or something. Anyway, for anyone who missed it: He told her the same thing in season 1, when they were locked in the storage room. First time her ""heart censor"" went off for Fuutarou.  

Anyway, as an Ichika fan I loved this episode, lots of screentime for my girl! And she was [so](https://imgur.com/LJ2BeOo) [damn](https://imgur.com/KksbFcb) [beautiful!](https://imgur.com/aolBfme), had a lot of good shots!"
1344,"Now we are starting to see development with the other characters in the show, it'll be interesting to see how this will affect the story. If Hinami ends up losing this election arc I wonder if it'll be the start of her downfall in everything else? She was number one in everything, the only thing she wasn't was in Tack-Fam. It must've been embarrassing to find out the only one who can beat her is someone who's not any better than her at anything else, so it makes sense she'd try to help him out. But by helping Tomozaki become a better person in the ""game of life"", it'll indirectly cause everyone Tomozaki interacts with to become better ""players"" as well. We saw this episode other characters are jealous of Hinami, and Tomozaki is in a way as well. Since he's the only one who can beat her at anything, he's aware of her weaknesses and will help the other girls take advantage of that. I could definitely see this going a route where everyone is trying to beat her but they don't realize that by doing so they're also hurting her mental health. Imagine just living life and then you notice everyone around you is trying to one up you in every way. I'm sure from her point of view it would feel like everyone hates you, even if that's not how they actually feel. Their relationships the sort where everyone views Hinami as a rival but judging by her reaction to Nanami trying to run for student council, it's the exact opposite for her. I wouldn't be surprised if something like this will happen and end up causing tears in their relationships because of misunderstandings, or possibly worse, actual hatred."
1345,"[I need more otaku friendly gyaru anime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnAo2PXQcJg). Nagatoro seems like it could a wave of adaptions of ongoing ones if it goes well. My Girlfriend is a Gal seems to be generally reviled but Galko-chan is some great stuff. I just wanna see more lol. Hopefully with a Sono Bisque Doll adaption eventually.

[Also this art](https://twitter.com/yaso80hachi/status/1359499944936181760) makes me wanna see a series with the reversal of roles with the otaku being the girl instead."
1346,"Same: She Always Prioritizes Her Love For Her Family Before Anything Else

As a girl, she had a deep love for her family, always putting them before herself. Even as her father disinherited her due to her perceived weakness, she still held that same love for them.

With how most of them treated her, it wouldn't have been strange to see her hold a grudge against them, yet, she continued to show overwhelming warmth to them. She agreed to marry Toneri in Naruto The Last, to save Hanabi on the moon, even if it meant hurting Naruto.

Especially the last 2 lines."
1347,"Why the heck would you not have an extra battery pack or even check the weather beforehand?  Not an outdoorsman but those seem like grave oversights by the girls.  This was actually a pretty dark episode but one that is so important.  Safety first and that means always be prepared.

Also those chairs are expensive as fuck."
1348,"Dai-Guard!
It's a fun show about office workers who become pilots of a promotional stunt robot which is the only defense against giant alien monsters.

The series was dubbed into English by ADV films in the defunct Monster Island Studios in Austin.

RetroCrush has it available for streaming (free with ads) in the USA.

Discotek got the home media license.
I picked it up on DVD when a local gaming store was clearing out their DVD rental library."

1350,"Happy lunar new year for those celebrating! Hope everyone is staying safe and enjoying the (lack of) festivities.

As for what’s happening this week, I’ve finally gotten around to starting Hades and after playing a week or so, other than being supremely good the whole package is as most have been saying, the main thing that stuck to me is the sheer amount of undercurrent horniness behind each character design."
1351,"Almost a decade ago I dropped NGE at the second to last episode because I hated Shinji and his mental breakdown over Kaworu drove me over the edge. 

I finished it recently along with EOE and now it's one of my favourites. I understand why I didn't like him last time but I don't feel that way at all anymore. I understand all the hype and praises now, it's really, really good."
1352,"While this is interesting  it does nothing to address the real problem. Poor treatment of employees is a broader issue across Asian economies, no doubt.

However, somewhere an HR consultancy is foaming at the mouth think about the revenue opportunity from fixing Japan's poor, pervasive employee experience. They treat employees poorly, everyone is depressed, high suicide rates overall, and economic stagnation/recessions from lack of innovation - which is impossible to do when you hate your job and are waiting to see whether your job will kill you before you kill yourself over your job.

If I were them, I'd start in the entertainment industry, especially anime studios."
1353,"Goblin Slayer, I like his straight, pragmatic approach to things. And it's funny when he overdoes it.

Nanami Aoyama in Sakurasou, she is a girl who in a misunderstanding listens to reason, and in another admits her mistake and apologises. The only anime girl I've seen who does that."
1354,"Re:Zero just keeps on getting better and better every week and I am genuinely impressed by the passion and effort put into this season despite the COVID-19 limitation factors affecting parts of the production quality for this wonderful series. Like seriously as a novel reader of this series, I give a salute to the hardworking animators and passionate directors for bringing life to this series for us fans."
1355,"Stuff licensed by Sentai Filmworks generally has the best value for the money of any anime company's stuff during big sales if you buy directly from their site. (They do big sales around Black Friday and Christmas, and sometimes at least once in the summer.) For example, they had complete series DVD sets for a lot of shows for only $3 each around the end of last year. (Blu-rays are more expensive than *that*, but still get pretty cheap.) They ship to both the US and Canada, but I don't know how much shipping to Canada costs. For obvious reasons, you can't buy stuff licensed by other companies like Funimation or Aniplex from them, though.

Stuff licensed by Aniplex is often cheaper to import from the UK instead of buying the region 1 release so long as you can figure out a way to play region 2 / region B discs. (Even if you had to buy a region-free player, you'd *still* have saved money in some cases; Aniplex stuff gets that expensive in the US, and I assume those prices extend to Canada, too.) Sometimes it can be hard to find the right page for that on Amason, but the trick is to search for it on the Amazon UK site and then change the URL to "".com"" instead of "".co.uk""; so long as anybody is selling the UK release on regular Amazon, that'll work to take you right to the right page. (Of course, you could just order from the Amazon UK site itself, but make sure to compare the shipping prices.)"
1356,"Revolutionary Girl Utena got my favorite OST in anime. The songs are pretty varied, while still having a well defined personality, making you immediately think about Utena, when you hear any of its tracks, whether it's one of its powerful and epic battle themes, or its relaxing elevator music. The songs are also well incorporated into the narrative, especially the lyrics of the battle themes, fitting the different opponents on stage.

My favorite song from the OST is [Tainai Tokei Toshi Oruroi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJl-TPPkQqs), but there is tons of powerful songs to pick from."
1357,"I never thought about it before till now but who is in charge of decision making for the body? Like are there brain cells? I remember the movie and tv series osmosis jones including brain cells and one being elected a “mayor”. 

IIRC, in osmosis jones, for the most part the individual made their own choices but sometimes the mayor would take control and override them. So I guess what I’m asking does the concept of brain cells and a “mayor” exist in this series or no?"
1358,"Bakarina aka My Next Life as a Villianess. Never thought a reverse harem could be so fun.

Machizado Mazoku - Thought it would be a pretty generic CGDCT but it had everything. Fantastic storyline, character interactions and development, funny as hell

Sleepy Princess in the Demon's Castle - Had no expectations going into this one, so unique and funny. Episode 3 with the touch me scenes were top tier hilarious

Higurashi - not usually a horror fan but this is the genre done right. Gore is not (usually) excessive but just enough interspersed to make the vibe very uncomfortable, like shit could go bad any minute and you never know when it's going to happen"
1359,"I know there was someone who made their own guide for the Naruto filler list eps. There are some that are not worth your time if you are into fillers and some that you may enjoy because its screentime for other characters. But, much of those fillers really wont do a timeskip because the actual timeskip happens after Naruto."
1360,"In any other series, Mimimi would be hailed as a best girl instantly, but she’s got blue hair, and thus suffers from blue hair syndrome, otherwise known as “being second place all her life”. It sucks so much since in my eyes, Mimimi is best girl since I find Aoi a bit too manipulative and “perfect” to be best girl. 

Anyways I commissioned a friend, a new and upcoming artist to draw Mimimi and it was absolutely adorable. [best girl hands down ](https://imgur.com/gallery/kEG4n70)"
1361,I’ve always wondered why fans of certain shows get mad when you don’t like their favorite anime at the end of the day it’s all subjective and everyone has different tastes. I don’t know this might have sounded stupid but this is just something I wanted to get off my chest.
1362,"it's still entertaining with some of it's comedy, so yah i'd say it's worth it if you enjoyed the game. 

but i was more bored by dangan ronpa: the animation (which is a copy of the first game) than dangan ronpa: end of hope's peak which shows us what happened before the start of the first game plus what happens after"
1363,"Clannad for sure. I watched it first when i was relatively new to anime and the first episode really felt off to me. The dialogue felt weird, the eyes were too big, and i was bored watching the SoL stuff, i only watched around 2-3 episodes.

Then after watching a shit ton of anime during the lockdown i decided to watch it again because of the reputation of After Story, and i absolutely loved it. The show starts off slow but i ended up enjoying Clannad a lot, mainly because of Tomoya and Nagisa. And then as expected, After Story was the 10/10 masterpiece that i had been promised."
1364,"Unfortunately no real term for that, but heres a few rather obscure  shows that fit this.

Ergo Proxy

Daughters of Mnemosyne (content in this show is pretty intense with themes of rape, depression and loss of self)

Kemonozume (much less religious ties than the previous)

D.Gray mam (really slow and not really romance)"
1365,"so im watching for the first time im on naruto (not shippuden) so i see after ep 142 they are just fillers and i see that the last episode is manga canon, so i wanted to ask like does anything interesting or significant happen between those 90 fillers (even a time skip or something)?"
1366,"Satoko a little baddie lowkey ?? https://imgur.com/a/uDUWnY8

So first half of this episode was really slice of lifey and you knew something dark was around the corner. Life isn’t as good as it seems at this new school. Satoko struggling and Rika thriving. I’m sure it’s intentional, but what is Rika playing at here? Maybe trying to draw Satoko out like when she pulled the gun? Can’t wait to find out.

I actually like this concept of a loop the most. Being in a different area, different school, new characters etc. Great episode."

1368,"Everything about this show is great. I usually don't watch openings, but the ""Ganbatte, Ganbatte!"" is so uplifting. 

Also all the characters are interesting. I think this is almost as good as Snafu, but our guy is no 8man yet."
1369,"Hi all, I’m nearly done watching DS and it was a fun watch. I liked the pace of it, given that i have trouble staying glued to the screen. Is there any other anime that I may enjoy because I liked demon slayer? I dont watch much, but i have watched/watch AoT, SOA, HxH, Death Note, DBZ, and maybe some others but these I really enjoyed. Thanks!"

1371,"I think I might finally start getting into the Tenchi Muyo series of shows. It looks like I watched at least some number of the OVA episodes on Toonami back when I was a kid, but I hardly remember them. I do remember watching GXP, but that was a real slog.

So, the body isn't doing too hot, eh? Intestines aren't doing well, AND cancer cell is back. I'm glad we got to see RBC again, and the platelets were cute as always. The final good bacteria we had was pretty cute too. Overall, great episode!

I see Killer T-cell is memory T-cell now. Did he get a promotion?"

want an anime that is to relax, but not necessarily pure comedy, but an anime in which good things happen every moment.

I want anime that can be comedy with less drama possible in the style of TONIKAWA, isekai smartphone and etc.

Anime that all right for the protagonist, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a romance or have a harem"

Dropped it after 4 episodes back in 2016, too much whining and disposable pussy characters

1375,"Edit: u/gentlejigai nice

Sounds like Alita Battle Angel.

I watched the 2019 movie version:

&#x200B;

>But Hugo runs afoul of the bounty hunter Zapan (Ed Skrein), who stabs him with his Damascus sword, leaving the young man to die. Luckily, Dyson's ex-wife, Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), is on hand, and decides to save Hugo by using her surgical technology to decapitate him -- a procedure that preserves brain activity even in the absence of a body. It's part of their plan to trick the police into thinking Alita is collecting the bounty on Hugo herself.  
>  
>After taking down Zapan, Alita rushes off to Dyson's lab, where he attaches Hugo's head onto a cybernetic body, making him more machine than man.

&#x200B;

>Her victory is short-lived, however, as she's informed Hugo is climbing a connecting tube to Zalem. Alita rushes to stop him, reliving the attack 300 years ago that resulted in the death of her entire battalion. It turns out their mission was to bring down the sky cty, only for the Death Rings (giant buzz saws) to come down, slice them up and leave Alita as the sole survivor in the scrap heap Dyson first found her.

&#x200B;

>She begs Hugo to return with her to Iron City, but it's too little, too late, as a ring takes him out. Alita tries to hold onto his dismembered body, but, sadly, he falls to his death.
